#Scheherazade's Story About Little Nemo

There was once an architectural forest from which few emerged. Little Nemo must have spoken the unutterable word, because he had arrived in that place. Little Nemo felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Little Nemo entered a wide and low terrace, tastefully offset by a sipapu. Little Nemo muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Little Nemo entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by an obelisk framed by a pattern of acanthus. Little Nemo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Little Nemo entered a luxurious tetrasoon, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter. Little Nemo felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Little Nemo entered a high tetrasoon, tastefully offset by a koi pond. Little Nemo wandered, lost in thought. 

Little Nemo entered a peristyle, dominated by a fireplace framed by a pattern of acanthus. Little Nemo felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Little Nemo entered a high tetrasoon, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter. Little Nemo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Little Nemo entered a rough kiva, tastefully offset by a trompe-l'oeil fresco. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

Dante Alighieri entered a fogou, tastefully offset by a koi pond. Dante Alighieri felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Dante Alighieri entered a luxurious terrace, dominated by divans lining the perimeter which was lined with a repeated pattern of arabseque. Dante Alighieri chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Dante Alighieri entered a rough fogou, tastefully offset by an obelisk. And that was where the encounter between a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a king of Persia named Shahryar took place. Dante Alighieri offered advice to Shahryar in the form of a story. So Dante Alighieri began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Dante Alighieri told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Dante Alighieri said, ending the story. 

Dante Alighieri decided to travel onwards. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Dante Alighieri entered a high liwan, dominated by a fallen column framed by a pattern of arabseque. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu. Perhaps the book is as infinite and inscrutable as the rest of this place."

Dante Alighieri wandered, lost in thought. 

Dante Alighieri entered a wide and low liwan, tastefully offset by a fireplace. Dante Alighieri thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Dante Alighieri entered a peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dante Alighieri entered a tetrasoon, tastefully offset by a koi pond. Dante Alighieri discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.

##Dante Alighieri's Story About Scheherazade

There was once a twisted garden that some call the unknown. Scheherazade was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Scheherazade muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Scheherazade entered a high terrace, dominated by a moasic which was lined with a repeated pattern of acanthus. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

"Well," she said, "It is as confusing as this maze. I hope that it's not important, because I can't read it."

Scheherazade felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Scheherazade entered a wide and low terrace, tastefully offset by a sipapu. Scheherazade wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Scheherazade entered a wide and low kiva, tastefully offset by a trompe-l'oeil fresco. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

"Well," she said, "That was quite useless."

Scheherazade chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Scheherazade entered a peristyle, dominated by a fireplace framed by a pattern of acanthus. Scheherazade walked away from that place. 

Scheherazade entered a cramped and narrow tetrasoon, tastefully offset by moki steps. Scheherazade thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Scheherazade entered a cramped and narrow liwan, dominated by a koi pond framed by a pattern of acanthus. Scheherazade chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Scheherazade entered a high peristyle, dominated by a koi pond framed by a pattern of acanthus. Scheherazade chose an exit at random and walked that way. And there Scheherazade reached the end of the labyrinth.

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Dante Alighieri said, ending the story. 

Dante Alighieri decided to travel onwards. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. Which was where Dante Alighieri found the exit. 

---

Thus Scheherazade ended her 9th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very exciting story. Thus Scheherazade ended her 10th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

#Scheherazade's Story About Dunyazad

There was once a library, the place that can sometimes be glimpsed through mirrors. Dunyazad couldn't quite say how she was wandering there. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a kiva, tastefully offset by an obelisk. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

"Well," she said, "I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu."

Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought. 

Dunyazad entered a rough fogou, tastefully offset by an obelisk. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dunyazad entered a liwan, tastefully offset by a fireplace. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a wide and low fogou, dominated by a fountain which was lined with a repeated pattern of arabseque. Dunyazad thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Dunyazad entered a cramped and narrow liwan, dominated by a trompe-l'oeil fresco framed by a pattern of acanthus. And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri took place. Dante Alighieri offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Dante Alighieri began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Dante Alighieri told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Dante Alighieri said, ending the story. 

Dunyazad decided to travel onwards. Dunyazad walked away from that place. 

Dunyazad entered a kiva, tastefully offset by an obelisk. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

"Well," she said, "I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu, or maybe it was written upside down."

Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought. 

Dunyazad entered a luxurious tetrasoon, dominated by an obelisk with a design of arabseque. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter. Dunyazad walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a kiva, tastefully offset by a fireplace. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.

"Well," she said, "I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu. Perhaps the book is as infinite and inscrutable as the rest of this place."

Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought. 

Dunyazad entered a wide and low kiva, dominated by a sipapu with a design of arabseque. Dunyazad thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Dunyazad entered a high terrace, tastefully offset by a sipapu. Dunyazad muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a wide and low tetrasoon, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence. Almost unable to believe it, Dunyazad reached the end of the labyrinth.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 11th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very exciting story. Thus Scheherazade ended her 12th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

#Scheherazade's Story About Dante Alighieri

There was once a recursive house of many doors that contained the entire world. Dante Alighieri was lost, like so many before and after, and he had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Dante Alighieri walked away from that place. 

Dante Alighieri entered a liwan, tastefully offset by a trompe-l'oeil fresco. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

Dante Alighieri entered a peristyle, tastefully offset by a koi pond. Dante Alighieri felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Dante Alighieri entered a tetrasoon, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter. Dante Alighieri chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Dante Alighieri entered a high kiva, dominated by a moasic with a design of acanthus. And that was where the encounter between a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a king of Persia named Shahryar took place. Dante Alighieri offered advice to Shahryar in the form of a story. So Dante Alighieri began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Dante Alighieri told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Dante Alighieri said, ending the story. 

Dante Alighieri decided to travel onwards. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Dante Alighieri entered a wide and low peristyle, tastefully offset by a koi pond. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu. Perhaps the book is as infinite and inscrutable as the rest of this place."

Dante Alighieri wandered, lost in thought. 

Dante Alighieri entered a high tetrasoon, tastefully offset by a moasic. Dante Alighieri thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Dante Alighieri entered a peristyle, dominated by a lararium framed by a pattern of arabseque. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. And there Dante Alighieri found the exit.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 13th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very exciting story. Thus Scheherazade ended her 14th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

#Scheherazade's Story About Dunyazad

There was once a recursive house of many doors that lived in eternal twilight. Dunyazad was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought. 

Dunyazad entered a fogou, tastefully offset by a koi pond. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a kiva, tastefully offset by an obelisk. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Dunyazad entered a peristyle, dominated by moki steps framed by a pattern of acanthus. Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Dunyazad entered a liwan, tastefully offset by a fireplace. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

"Well," she said, "Perhaps it's a list of names? Or a crossword puzzle that was filled in wrong. Perhaps there's a code."

Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Dunyazad entered a luxurious fogou, tastefully offset by a trompe-l'oeil fresco. Dunyazad thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Dunyazad entered a liwan, tastefully offset by a fireplace. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Dunyazad entered a kiva, tastefully offset by an obelisk. Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought. 

Dunyazad entered a fogou, tastefully offset by a fountain. Dunyazad thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Dunyazad entered a wide and low tetrasoon, dominated by a fountain with a design of acanthus. Dunyazad muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.

Dunyazad entered a terrace, tastefully offset by a fountain. And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan took place. Dunyazad offered advice to Kublai Khan in the form of a story. So Dunyazad began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..."

So Dunyazad began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Dunyazad told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Dunyazad said, ending the story. 

Dunyazad decided to travel onwards. Dunyazad muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.

"Well," he said, "It is as confusing as this maze."

Asterion wandered, lost in thought. 

Asterion entered a liwan, tastefully offset by a fallen column. Asterion felt sure that this must be the way out. Quite unexpectedly Asterion found the exit.

#Scheherazade's Story

Once upon a time, there was a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu, the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a king of Persia named Shahryar. Dunyazad suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Dunyazad told a very exciting story. Thus Dunyazad ended her 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

##Jorge Luis Borges's Story About Shahryar

There was once a library just on the other side of the garden wall. Shahryar must have gotten lost, because he was wandering there. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Shahryar entered a kiva, dominated by moki steps with a design of arabseque. Shahryar muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Shahryar entered a fogou, tastefully offset by a fireplace. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Shahryar entered a high terrace, dominated by a moasic which was lined with a repeated pattern of acanthus. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Shahryar entered a liwan, tastefully offset by a fireplace. Shahryar opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. Quite unexpectedly Shahryar reached the end of the labyrinth.

#Scheherazade's Story About Dunyazad

There was once a mysterious labyrinth that lived in eternal twilight. Dunyazad wasn't quite sure where this was, only that she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Dunyazad walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a luxurious fogou, tastefully offset by a trompe-l'oeil fresco. Dunyazad muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Dunyazad entered a kiva, tastefully offset by an obelisk. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a kiva, tastefully offset by an obelisk. Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Dunyazad entered a rough liwan, dominated by an obelisk framed by a pattern of acanthus. And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a member of royalty named Asterion took place. Asterion offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Asterion began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

##Asterion's Story About Virgil

There was once a recursive house of many doors that contained the entire world. Virgil must have gotten lost, because he was wandering there. Virgil thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Virgil entered a high fogou, tastefully offset by moki steps. Virgil thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Virgil entered a luxurious kiva, dominated by a moasic with a design of arabseque. Virgil walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Virgil entered a high peristyle, tastefully offset by a moasic. Virgil thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. At the darkest hour Virgil discovered the way out.

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Asterion said, ending the story. 

Dunyazad decided to travel onwards. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a liwan, tastefully offset by a trompe-l'oeil fresco. Dunyazad walked away from that place. 

Dunyazad entered a peristyle, dominated by a moasic framed by a pattern of arabseque. Dunyazad muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened.

Scheherazade entered a rough fogou, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu. I hope that it's not important, because I can't read it."

Virgil felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Virgil entered a liwan, tastefully offset by a fallen column. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Virgil entered a kiva, tastefully offset by an obelisk. Virgil muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. Which was where Virgil discovered the way out.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 35th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very exciting story. Thus Scheherazade ended her 36th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

#Scheherazade's Story About Kublai Khan

There was once an architectural forest from which few emerged. Kublai Khan didn't know why he happened to be there. Kublai Khan wandered, lost in thought. 

Kublai Khan entered a tetrasoon, tastefully offset by a fallen column. Kublai Khan chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Kublai Khan entered a terrace, dominated by a fountain which was lined with a repeated pattern of arabseque. And that was where the encounter between a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri took place. Dante Alighieri offered advice to Kublai Khan in the form of a story. So Dante Alighieri began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

##Dante Alighieri's Story

Once upon a time, there was a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo, a philosopher named Socrates and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad. Little Nemo suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Little Nemo told:


###Little Nemo's Story

Once upon a time, there was a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo, a member of royalty named Asterion and a queen of Persia named Scheherazade. Scheherazade suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very exciting story. "And that was how it happened," Scheherazade said, ending her story.

"And that was how it happened," Little Nemo said, ending his story.

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Dante Alighieri said, ending the story. 

Kublai Khan decided to travel onwards. Kublai Khan chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Kublai Khan entered a wide and low liwan, tastefully offset by a fireplace. Kublai Khan chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Kublai Khan entered a tetrasoon, tastefully offset by a koi pond. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

Socrates entered a high terrace, dominated by moki steps which was lined with a repeated pattern of arabseque. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

##Scheherazade's Story About Scheherazade

Murasaki Shikibu decided to travel onwards. Murasaki Shikibu opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a high kiva, dominated by a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of acanthus. Murasaki Shikibu felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a wide and low tetrasoon, dominated by divans lining the perimeter with a design of acanthus. Murasaki Shikibu felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a wide and low tetrasoon, dominated by a fountain with a design of arabseque. Murasaki Shikibu walked away from that place. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a rough fogou, dominated by a fireplace which was lined with a repeated pattern of acanthus. Murasaki Shikibu muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.

#Scheherazade's Story About Scheherazade

Jorge Luis Borges entered a tetrasoon, tastefully offset by a fallen column. And that was where the encounter between a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges and a member of royalty named Asterion took place. Jorge Luis Borges offered advice to Asterion in the form of a story. So Jorge Luis Borges began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

###Jorge Luis Borges's Story About Little Nemo

There was once an architectural forest, which is the world. Little Nemo must have spoken the unutterable word, because he had arrived in that place. Little Nemo felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Little Nemo entered a wide and low tetrasoon, dominated by a fountain with a design of acanthus. Little Nemo wandered, lost in thought. 

Little Nemo entered a high kiva, dominated by a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of acanthus. Little Nemo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Little Nemo entered a tetrasoon, dominated by a sipapu with a design of arabseque. Little Nemo felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Little Nemo entered a tetrasoon, tastefully offset by a fallen column. Little Nemo chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Little Nemo entered a luxurious tetrasoon, dominated by an obelisk with a design of arabseque. And that was where the encounter between a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo and a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri took place. Little Nemo offered advice to Dante Alighieri in the form of a story. So Little Nemo began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Little Nemo told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Little Nemo said, ending the story. 

Little Nemo decided to travel onwards. Little Nemo wandered, lost in thought. 

Little Nemo entered a wide and low peristyle, dominated by an obelisk framed by a pattern of acanthus. Little Nemo chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Little Nemo entered a luxurious fogou, dominated by divans lining the perimeter which was lined with a repeated pattern of acanthus. Little Nemo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Little Nemo entered a liwan, dominated by a trompe-l'oeil fresco framed by a pattern of arabseque. Little Nemo felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Little Nemo entered a luxurious peristyle, dominated by a koi pond framed by a pattern of arabseque. Little Nemo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Little Nemo entered a luxurious peristyle, tastefully offset by a sipapu. Little Nemo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.
