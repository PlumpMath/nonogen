<p>Dante Alighieri entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>

And that was where the encounter between a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo took place. Dante Alighieri offered advice to Marco Polo in the form of a story. So Dante Alighieri began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>

<p>Scheherazade entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror.

So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Dante Alighieri told a very intertwined story. &quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Dante Alighieri said, ending his story.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thus Scheherazade ended her 263rd story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>
<p>So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>
<p>This is the story that Scheherazade told:</p>

<p>There was once a vast and perilous maze that was a map of itself. Homer must have gotten lost, because he was wandering there. Homer muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.</p>
<p>Homer entered a twilit almonry, watched over by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing. Homer thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror.</p>
<p>Homer entered a twilit fogou, decorated with a koi pond which was lined with a repeated pattern of imbrication. Homer felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Homer entered a shadowy almonry, that had a crumbling mound of earth. Homer wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Homer entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, , within which was found a pair of komaninu. Homer muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.</p>

<p>And he told the following story:</p>

<p>Homer decided to travel onwards. Homer discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror.</p>
<p>Homer entered a cramped and narrow fogou, watched over by a monolith. Homer wandered, lost in thought. At the darkest hour Homer reached the end of the labyrinth.</p>

<p>Socrates felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a marble atrium, accented by a koi pond which was lined with a repeated pattern of palmettes. Socrates chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.</p>

<p>Socrates opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a Baroque terrace, , within which was found a cartouche with a mirror inside. Socrates felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Socrates muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, , within which was found a pair of komaninu. Socrates thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a brick-walled triclinium, watched over by a fireplace. Socrates felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. And that was where the encounter between a philosopher named Socrates and an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo took place. Marco Polo offered advice to Socrates in the form of a story. So Marco Polo began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<h3 id="marco-polos-story-about-jorge-luis-borges-1">Marco Polo's Story About Jorge Luis Borges</h3>
<p>There was once an expansive zone that was a map of itself. Jorge Luis Borges must have gotten lost, because he was wandering there. Jorge Luis Borges muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Jorge Luis Borges thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Jorge Luis Borges felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Jorge Luis Borges chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a archaic atelier, tastefully offset by an alcove framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. Jorge Luis Borges walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a high portico, decorated with a great many columns with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Jorge Luis Borges opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a wide and low lumber room, that had a great many columns. Jorge Luis Borges felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. Jorge Luis Borges chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. Quite unexpectedly Jorge Luis Borges discovered the way out.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Marco Polo said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Socrates decided to travel onwards. Socrates discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Socrates wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a luxurious cryptoporticus, containing an alcove. Socrates walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a art deco rotunda, accented by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of blue stones. And that was where the encounter between a philosopher named Socrates and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad took place. Dunyazad offered advice to Socrates in the form of a story. So Dunyazad began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And she told the following story:</p>
<h3 id="dunyazads-inspiring-story-1">Dunyazad's inspiring Story</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, there was an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer, a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo and a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan. Little Nemo suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Little Nemo told a very symbolic story. &quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Little Nemo said, ending his story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Dunyazad said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Socrates decided to travel onwards. Socrates felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a art deco tablinum, containing a fireplace. Socrates chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a ominous peristyle, that had a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing. Socrates discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. At the darkest hour Socrates found the exit.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thus Scheherazade ended her 265th story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>
<p>So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Scheherazade told a very touching story. Thus Scheherazade ended her 266th story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>
<p>So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>
<p>This is the story that Scheherazade told:</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a blind poet named Homer, a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges and a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo. Jorge Luis Borges suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Jorge Luis Borges told a very convoluted story. &quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Jorge Luis Borges said, ending his story.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thus Scheherazade ended her 267th story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>

Dante Alighieri suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Dante Alighieri told a very intertwined story. &quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Dante Alighieri said, ending his story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Kublai Khan said, ending his story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Jorge Luis Borges said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges decided to travel onwards. Jorge Luis Borges chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a rococo picture gallery, dominated by a sipapu framed by a pattern of chevrons. Jorge Luis Borges discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a archaic tetrasoon, tastefully offset by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of pearl inlay. Jorge Luis Borges wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a primitive colonnade, , within which was found divans lining the perimeter. Jorge Luis Borges walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a marble hall of mirrors, accented by a false door framed by a pattern of palmettes. Jorge Luis Borges opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Jorge Luis Borges felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a twilit almonry, dominated by an empty cartouche which was lined with a repeated pattern of imbrication. Jorge Luis Borges felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a luxurious portico, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of arabseque. Jorge Luis Borges chose an exit at random and walked that way. Quite unexpectedly Jorge Luis Borges discovered the way out.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thus Scheherazade ended her 283rd story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>
<p>So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>
<p>This is the story that Scheherazade told:</p>

Dante Alighieri suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Dante Alighieri told a very intertwined story. &quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Dante Alighieri said, ending his story.</p>

<p>&quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Kublai Khan said, ending his story.</p>

<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Jorge Luis Borges said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges decided to travel onwards. Jorge Luis Borges chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Jorge Luis Borges discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a cramped and narrow cryptoporticus, containing a sipapu. Jorge Luis Borges wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Jorge Luis Borges walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a ominous sudatorium, tastefully offset by a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Jorge Luis Borges opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a Churrigueresque hedge maze, that had a false door. Jorge Luis Borges felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. And there Jorge Luis Borges found the exit.</p>

<p>Marco Polo felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>

<p>This is the story that Scheherazade told:</p>
<h2 id="scheherazades-story-about-kublai-khan-2">Scheherazade's Story About Kublai Khan</h2>
<p>There was once a vast and perilous maze just on the other side of the garden wall. Kublai Khan was lost, like so many before and after, and he had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Kublai Khan chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. Kublai Khan muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Kublai Khan thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a Baroque arborium, watched over by a curved staircase. Kublai Khan felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a Churrigueresque atelier, watched over by moki steps. Kublai Khan chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a twilit almonry, watched over by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing. Kublai Khan discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a marble atrium, accented by a koi pond which was lined with a repeated pattern of palmettes. Kublai Khan opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>

<p>Kublai Khan entered a marble picture gallery, that had an abat-son. Kublai Khan muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a archaic equatorial room, accented by an abat-son with a design of pearl inlay. And that was where the encounter between a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri took place. Kublai Khan offered advice to Dante Alighieri in the form of a story. So Kublai Khan began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<h3 id="kublai-khans-important-story-29">Kublai Khan's important Story</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan, a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo and an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo. Little Nemo suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Little Nemo told a very convoluted story. &quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Little Nemo said, ending his story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Kublai Khan said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan decided to travel onwards. Kublai Khan chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>

<p>Kublai Khan entered a Baroque still room, that had a gilt-framed mirror. And that was where the encounter between a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and a member of royalty named Asterion took place. Kublai Khan offered advice to Asterion in the form of a story. So Kublai Khan began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>

<h3 id="kublai-khans-story-about-socrates">Kublai Khan's Story About Socrates</h3>
<p>There was once a cybertextual data structure just on the other side of the garden wall. Socrates had followed a secret path, and so he had arrived in that place. Socrates walked away from that place.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad, an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer and a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan. Geoffery Chaucer suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday.
