"Well," he said, "Perhaps it's a list of names? Or a crossword puzzle that was filled in wrong. Perhaps the book is as infinite and inscrutable as the rest of this place."

Virgil walked away from that place. 

Virgil entered a looming atelier, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of scratched markings. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Virgil entered a twilit kiva, tastefully offset by a fallen column with a design of imbrication. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Virgil entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Virgil muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Virgil entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Virgil thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Virgil entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Virgil felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Virgil entered a rococo triclinium, , within which was found a pair of komaninu. Virgil wandered, lost in thought.

And that was where the encounter between a poet of Rome named Virgil and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Virgil offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Virgil began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

######Virgil's important Story

Once upon a time, there was a queen of Persia named Scheherazade, a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu. Kublai Khan suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Kublai Khan told a very intertwined story. Thus Kublai Khan ended his 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Kublai Khan told:


#######Kublai Khan's inspiring Story

Once upon a time, there was a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu, the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a poet of Rome named Virgil. Dunyazad suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Dunyazad told a very touching story. "And that was how it happened," Dunyazad said, ending her story.

#######Kublai Khan's Story About Asterion

There was once a mysterious labyrinth that lived in eternal twilight. Asterion couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Asterion chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Asterion entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Asterion discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.

There was once a twilight dimention in space that some call the unknown. Virgil couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Virgil entered a looming atelier, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of scratched markings. Virgil muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Virgil entered a rough picture gallery, tastefully offset by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of acanthus. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

##Scheherazade's Story About Dante Alighieri

There was once a mysterious labyrinth that lived in eternal twilight. Dante Alighieri wasn't quite sure where this was, only that he had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Dante Alighieri walked away from that place. 

Dante Alighieri entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Dante Alighieri entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Dante Alighieri thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Dante Alighieri entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Dante Alighieri felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Dante Alighieri entered a high portico, decorated with a great many columns with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Dante Alighieri chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Dante Alighieri entered a shadowy picture gallery, accented by moki steps which was lined with a repeated pattern of carved runes. Dante Alighieri discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Dante Alighieri entered a neoclassic fogou, that had moki steps. Dante Alighieri wandered, lost in thought. 

Dante Alighieri entered a brick-walled tablinum, accented by a fireplace with a design of taijitu. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dante Alighieri entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Dante Alighieri entered a rough spicery, decorated with a fire in a low basin framed by a pattern of acanthus. And that was where the encounter between a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a poet of Rome named Virgil took place. Dante Alighieri offered advice to Virgil in the form of a story. So Dante Alighieri began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

Virgil entered a primitive picture gallery, decorated with a great many columns with a design of red gems. Virgil muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Virgil entered a looming tepidarium, watched over by a cartouche with a mirror inside. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "That explains a lot. Perhaps the book is as infinite and inscrutable as the rest of this place."

Virgil walked away from that place. 

Virgil entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Virgil entered a luxurious cryptoporticus, containing an alcove. Virgil thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Virgil entered a archaic still room, accented by a curved staircase framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. Virgil felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Virgil entered a brick-walled liwan, containing a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground. Virgil chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Virgil entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Virgil entered a primitive hedge maze, accented by a cartouche with a mirror inside framed by a pattern of red gems. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Virgil entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Virgil felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Virgil entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. And that was where the encounter between a poet of Rome named Virgil and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad took place. Virgil offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Virgil began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

#######Virgil's Story About Scheherazade

There was once a twisted garden that lived in eternal twilight. Scheherazade was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Scheherazade chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Scheherazade entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Scheherazade discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Scheherazade entered a rough spicery, , within which was found a gilt-framed mirror. Scheherazade opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Scheherazade entered a cramped and narrow fogou, watched over by a monolith. Scheherazade felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. Which was where Scheherazade reached the end of the labyrinth. 

---

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Virgil said, ending the story. 

Virgil decided to travel onwards. Virgil chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Virgil entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Virgil discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Virgil entered a twilit hall of mirrors, containing divans lining the perimeter. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Virgil entered a high fogou, containing a fallen column. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. Which was where Virgil reached the end of the labyrinth. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Asterion said, ending his story. 

---

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Little Nemo said, ending the story. 

Little Nemo decided to travel onwards. Little Nemo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. Quite unexpectedly Little Nemo found the exit. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Dunyazad said, ending her story. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Murasaki Shikibu said, ending her story. 

---

Thus Scheherazade ended her 717th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

##Scheherazade's Story About Scheherazade

There was once a twilight dimention in space that lived in eternal twilight. Scheherazade must have spoken the unutterable word, because she had arrived in that place. Scheherazade walked away from that place. 

Scheherazade entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a false door framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Scheherazade opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Scheherazade entered a Baroque picture gallery, dominated by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of buta motifs. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

Scheherazade decided to travel onwards. Scheherazade thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Scheherazade entered a archaic antechamber, , within which was found a cartouche with a mirror inside. Scheherazade felt sure that this must be the way out.

"Well," she said, "That explains a lot. Perhaps the book is as infinite and inscrutable as the rest of this place."

Scheherazade walked away from that place. 

Scheherazade entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Scheherazade opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Scheherazade entered a high portico, decorated with a great many columns with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Scheherazade thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Scheherazade entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Scheherazade felt sure that this must be the way out.

Scheherazade entered a high spicery, accented by a gilt-framed mirror with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. And that was where the encounter between a queen of Persia named Scheherazade and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad took place. Scheherazade offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Scheherazade began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And she told the following story:

###Scheherazade's Story About Scheherazade

There was once a twisted garden that lived in eternal twilight. Scheherazade was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Scheherazade chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Scheherazade entered a high picture gallery, watched over by a glass-framed mirror. Scheherazade discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Scheherazade entered a brick-walled terrace, accented by an exedra which was lined with a repeated pattern of taijitu. Scheherazade opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.

Scheherazade entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Scheherazade muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Scheherazade entered a primitive atelier, watched over by a fountain. Scheherazade thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. At the darkest hour Scheherazade found the exit.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 718th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very touching story. Thus Scheherazade ended her 719th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very exciting story. Thus Scheherazade ended her 720th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:


##Scheherazade's important Story

Once upon a time, there was a queen of Persia named Scheherazade, a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu. Jorge Luis Borges suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Jorge Luis Borges told a very convoluted story. Thus Jorge Luis Borges ended his 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Jorge Luis Borges told:


###Jorge Luis Borges's recursive Story

Once upon a time, there was a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu, a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad. Little Nemo suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Little Nemo told:


####Little Nemo's important Story

Once upon a time, there was a poet of Rome named Virgil, a member of royalty named Asterion and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad. Asterion suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Asterion told:

#####Asterion's Story About Virgil

There was once a twilight dimention in space that some call the unknown. Virgil couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Virgil entered a looming colonnade, watched over by a fireplace. Virgil muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Virgil entered a twilit hall of mirrors, containing divans lining the perimeter. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "Perhaps it's a list of names? Or a crossword puzzle that was filled in wrong."

Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Shahryar entered a marble-floored darbazi, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of complex interlacing. Shahryar discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Shahryar entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. And that was where the encounter between a king of Persia named Shahryar and a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri took place. Shahryar offered advice to Dante Alighieri in the form of a story. So Shahryar began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Shahryar told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Shahryar said, ending the story. 

Shahryar decided to travel onwards. Shahryar wandered, lost in thought. 

Shahryar entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Shahryar entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. And that was where the encounter between a king of Persia named Shahryar and a member of royalty named Asterion took place. Shahryar offered advice to Asterion in the form of a story. So Shahryar began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

####Shahryar's recursive Story

Once upon a time, there was a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri, a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a member of royalty named Asterion. Murasaki Shikibu suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Murasaki Shikibu told a very exciting story. Thus Murasaki Shikibu ended her 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Murasaki Shikibu told:


#####Murasaki Shikibu's moving Story

Once upon a time, there was a king of Persia named Shahryar, a queen of Persia named Scheherazade and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu.

"And that was how it happened," Scheherazade said, ending her story. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Murasaki Shikibu said, ending her story. 

---

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Shahryar said, ending the story. 

Shahryar decided to travel onwards. Shahryar muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Shahryar entered a marble-floored tepidarium, tastefully offset by an exedra which was lined with a repeated pattern of complex interlacing. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Shahryar entered a high picture gallery, watched over by a glass-framed mirror. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Shahryar entered a rococo cavaedium, dominated by a gilt-framed mirror with a design of chevrons. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Shahryar entered a high fogou, containing a fallen column. Shahryar discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. Almost unable to believe it, Shahryar found the exit. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Marco Polo said, ending his story. 

---

Thus Scheherazade ended her 732nd story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

##Scheherazade's Story About Dante Alighieri

There was once a recursive house of many doors that lived in eternal twilight. Dante Alighieri wasn't quite sure where this was, only that he had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous 사랑방, watched over by a fallen column. Dante Alighieri chose an exit at random and walked that way.

Dante Alighieri entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Dante Alighieri wandered, lost in thought. 

Dante Alighieri entered a high triclinium, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Dante Alighieri walked away from that place. 

Dante Alighieri entered a rough tetrasoon, that had a monolith. Dante Alighieri thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Dante Alighieri entered a primitive peristyle, decorated with a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of red gems. Dante Alighieri discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Dante Alighieri entered a brick-walled equatorial room, tastefully offset by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of taijitu. Dante Alighieri wandered, lost in thought. Which was where Dante Alighieri reached the end of the labyrinth. 

---

Thus Scheherazade ended her 733rd story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very symbolic story. Thus Scheherazade ended her 734th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

###Shahryar's Story About Little Nemo

There was once a mysterious labyrinth that some call the unknown. Little Nemo was almost certain about why he happened to be there. Little Nemo wandered, lost in thought. 

Little Nemo entered a luxurious library, watched over by a gilt-framed mirror. Little Nemo walked away from that place. 

Little Nemo entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Little Nemo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Little Nemo entered a rough triclinium, decorated with an obelisk with a design of acanthus. Little Nemo felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Little Nemo entered a high spicery, accented by a gilt-framed mirror with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "That explains a lot. Maybe it's in a language I don't know."

Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Shahryar entered a neoclassic almonry, accented by a quatrefoil carved into the wall with a design of guilloché. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Shahryar entered a shadowy picture gallery, accented by moki steps which was lined with a repeated pattern of carved runes. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Shahryar entered a high picture gallery, watched over by a glass-framed mirror. Shahryar walked away from that place. 

Shahryar entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Shahryar opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Shahryar entered a marble darbazi, , within which was found a fireplace. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.

"Well," he said, "It is as confusing as this maze."

Shahryar wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Shahryar entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Shahryar walked away from that place.

"Well," he said, "I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu."

Shahryar muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened.

Shahryar entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. Shahryar opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

##Scheherazade's Story About Scheherazade

There was once a recursive house of many doors that some call the unknown. Scheherazade couldn't quite say how she was wandering there. Scheherazade felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Scheherazade entered a Baroque terrace, , within which was found a cartouche with a mirror inside. Scheherazade chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Scheherazade entered a twilit fogou, decorated with a koi pond which was lined with a repeated pattern of imbrication. Scheherazade discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Scheherazade entered a marble darbazi, , within which was found a fireplace. Scheherazade wandered, lost in thought.

Scheherazade entered a wide and low portico, watched over by an abat-son. And that was where the encounter between a queen of Persia named Scheherazade and a philosopher named Socrates took place. Scheherazade offered advice to Socrates in the form of a story. So Scheherazade began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Scheherazade told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Scheherazade said, ending the story. 

Scheherazade decided to travel onwards. Scheherazade felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Scheherazade entered a brick-walled cavaedium, watched over by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. Scheherazade muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Scheherazade entered a looming atrium, decorated with a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of scratched markings. Scheherazade thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Scheherazade entered a brick-walled colonnade, decorated with a great many columns with a design of taijitu. Scheherazade felt sure that this must be the way out.

And he told the following story:

###Shahryar's touching Story

Once upon a time, there was a member of royalty named Asterion, an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer and a king of Persia named Shahryar. Geoffery Chaucer suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Geoffery Chaucer told:


####Geoffery Chaucer's amusing Story

Once upon a time, there was a philosopher named Socrates, an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad. Geoffery Chaucer suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Geoffery Chaucer told a very intertwined story.

####Geoffery Chaucer's Story About Geoffery Chaucer

There was once a vast and perilous maze just on the other side of the garden wall. Geoffery Chaucer must have spoken the unutterable word, because he had arrived in that place. Geoffery Chaucer walked away from that place. 

Geoffery Chaucer entered a rough rotunda, that had a great many columns. Geoffery Chaucer opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.

"Well," she said, "That was quite useless. Maybe it's in a language I don't know."

Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Dunyazad entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Dunyazad walked away from that place. 

Dunyazad entered a rough triclinium, decorated with an obelisk with a design of acanthus. Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Dunyazad entered a looming atrium, decorated with a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of scratched markings. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a high triclinium, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Dunyazad muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Dunyazad entered a rococo cyzicene hall, containing a moasic. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Dunyazad entered a primitive tetrasoon, that had a wood-framed mirror. And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a queen of Persia named Scheherazade took place. Dunyazad offered advice to Scheherazade in the form of a story. So Dunyazad began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And she told the following story:

#####Dunyazad's inspiring Story

Once upon a time, there was the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad, a member of royalty named Asterion and an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer. Asterion suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Asterion told a very touching story. "And that was how it happened," Asterion said, ending his story. 

---

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Dunyazad said, ending the story. 

Dunyazad decided to travel onwards. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Dunyazad entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. Almost unable to believe it, Dunyazad found the exit. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Homer said, ending his story. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Scheherazade said, ending her story. 

---

Thus Scheherazade ended her 798th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

##Scheherazade's Story About Marco Polo

There was once a cybertextual data structure just on the other side of the garden wall. Marco Polo had followed a secret path, and so he had arrived in that place. Marco Polo walked away from that place. 

Marco Polo entered a Churrigueresque cyzicene hall, , within which was found a fountain. Marco Polo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Marco Polo entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Marco Polo felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Marco Polo entered a Churrigueresque cyzicene hall, , within which was found a fountain. Marco Polo felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Marco Polo entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. Marco Polo chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Marco Polo entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Marco Polo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Marco Polo entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Marco Polo wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Marco Polo entered a wide and low cavaedium, watched over by a curved staircase. Marco Polo walked away from that place. 

Marco Polo entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Marco Polo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Marco Polo entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Marco Polo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Marco Polo entered a rough tetrasoon, that had a monolith. Marco Polo felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Marco Polo entered a high triclinium, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Marco Polo chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Marco Polo entered a Churrigueresque twilit solar, watched over by an abat-son. Marco Polo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Marco Polo entered a ominous peristyle, that had a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing. Marco Polo felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. Quite unexpectedly Marco Polo reached the end of the labyrinth. 

---

Thus Scheherazade ended her 799th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

##Scheherazade's Story About Socrates

There was once an engmatic labyrinth that had never known the light of the sun. Socrates couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Socrates felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Socrates entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Socrates muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Socrates entered a twilit almonry, watched over by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "That was quite useless. Maybe it's in a language I don't know."

Socrates opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Socrates entered a marble hall of mirrors, accented by a false door framed by a pattern of palmettes. Socrates felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Socrates entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Socrates wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Socrates entered a high picture gallery, watched over by a glass-framed mirror. Socrates walked away from that place. 

Socrates entered a archaic antechamber, , within which was found a cartouche with a mirror inside. Socrates opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Socrates entered a marble atrium, accented by a koi pond which was lined with a repeated pattern of palmettes. Socrates felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Socrates entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Socrates muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Socrates entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Socrates chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Socrates entered a marble hall of mirrors, accented by a false door framed by a pattern of palmettes. And that was where the encounter between a philosopher named Socrates and a queen of Persia named Scheherazade took place. Socrates offered advice to Scheherazade in the form of a story. So Socrates began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

###Socrates's inspiring Story

Once upon a time, there was the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad, a member of royalty named Asterion and an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer. Asterion suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Asterion told a very touching story. "And that was how it happened," Asterion said, ending his story. 

---

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Socrates said, ending the story. 

Socrates decided to travel onwards. Socrates discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Socrates entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Socrates opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Socrates entered a primitive peristyle, decorated with a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of red gems. And that was where the encounter between a philosopher named Socrates and a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo took place. Socrates offered advice to Little Nemo in the form of a story. So Socrates began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Socrates told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Socrates said, ending the story. 

Socrates decided to travel onwards. Socrates muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. Which was where Socrates discovered the way out.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 800th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very touching story. Thus Scheherazade ended her 801st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:


##Scheherazade's amusing Story

Once upon a time, there was an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo, a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo and an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer. Little Nemo suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Little Nemo told a very intertwined story. "And that was how it happened," Little Nemo said, ending his story. 

---

Thus Scheherazade ended her 802nd story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

##Scheherazade's Story About Socrates

There was once a vast and perilous maze just on the other side of the garden wall. Socrates must have gotten lost, because he was wandering there. Socrates walked away from that place. 

Socrates entered a wide and low cavaedium, watched over by a curved staircase. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

##Scheherazade's Story About Kublai Khan

Kublai Khan entered a archaic almonry, , within which was found a wood-framed mirror. Kublai Khan muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened.

Marco Polo muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Marco Polo entered a ominous peristyle, that had a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing. Marco Polo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. Almost unable to believe it, Marco Polo discovered the way out.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 822nd story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

##Scheherazade's Story About Socrates

There was once a library that had never known the light of the sun. Socrates couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Socrates wandered, lost in thought. 

Socrates entered a rococo triclinium, , within which was found a pair of komaninu. Socrates walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Socrates entered a wide and low portico, watched over by an abat-son. Socrates opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Socrates entered a wide and low kiva, that had a false door. Socrates felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Socrates entered a archaic still room, containing a beautiful fresco. Socrates felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Socrates entered a high terrace, watched over by a trompe-l'oeil fresco. Socrates chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Socrates entered a marble hall of mirrors, accented by a false door framed by a pattern of palmettes. Socrates discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Socrates entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, , within which was found a pair of komaninu. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "Somehow, it reminds me of tigers."

Socrates thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. Almost unable to believe it, Socrates found the exit.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 823rd story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very convoluted story. Thus Scheherazade ended her 824th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:


##Scheherazade's recursive Story

Once upon a time, there was an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer, a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges and a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan. Jorge Luis Borges suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Jorge Luis Borges told a very exciting story. "And that was how it happened," Jorge Luis Borges said, ending his story.

##Scheherazade's Story About Homer

There was once a cybertextual data structure that was a map of itself. Homer must have gotten lost, because he was wandering there. Homer muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Homer entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Homer thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Homer entered a twilit fogou, decorated with a koi pond which was lined with a repeated pattern of imbrication. Homer felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Homer entered a cramped and narrow terrace, tastefully offset by a beautiful fresco framed by a pattern of three hares. Homer felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Homer entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Homer muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Homer entered a wide and low portico, watched over by an abat-son. Homer thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Homer entered a high triclinium, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "That explains a lot."

Homer opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Homer entered a high triclinium, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Homer felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Homer entered a Churrigueresque hedge maze, that had a false door. Homer muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Homer entered a brick-walled kiva, watched over by a monolith. Homer chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Homer entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Homer discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Homer entered a rococo tablinum, that had a great many columns. Homer wandered, lost in thought. 

Homer entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "It is as confusing as this maze. I hope that it's not important, because I can't read it."

Homer felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Homer entered a luxurious portico, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of arabseque. Homer chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. At the darkest hour Homer discovered the way out.

##Scheherazade's Story About Dunyazad

There was once a vast and perilous maze, the place that can sometimes be glimpsed through mirrors. Dunyazad couldn't quite say how she was wandering there. Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought. 

Dunyazad entered a high arborium, decorated with xoanon with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Dunyazad walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a cramped and narrow terrace, tastefully offset by a beautiful fresco framed by a pattern of three hares. Dunyazad muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a high picture gallery, watched over by a glass-framed mirror. Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought. 

Dunyazad entered a rococo hall of doors, that had a moasic. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Dunyazad entered a art deco rotunda, accented by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of blue stones. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.

Dunyazad entered a luxurious portico, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of arabseque. Dunyazad muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a primitive peristyle, decorated with a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of red gems. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

##Scheherazade's amusing Story

Once upon a time, there was a blind poet named Homer, a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo. Murasaki Shikibu suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Murasaki Shikibu told a very intertwined story. "And that was how it happened," Murasaki Shikibu said, ending her story.

Dunyazad entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:
