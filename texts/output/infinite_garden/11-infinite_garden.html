<p>Murasaki Shikibu walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a archaic hall of doors, containing a koi pond. Murasaki Shikibu opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a luxurious peristyle, tastefully offset by a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of arabseque.

Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Scheherazade in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Murasaki Shikibu told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Murasaki Shikibu said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu decided to travel onwards. Murasaki Shikibu thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>

<p>Shahryar entered a art deco hall of doors, tastefully offset by an empty cartouche which was lined with a repeated pattern of blue stones. And that was where the encounter between a king of Persia named Shahryar and a poet of Rome named Virgil took place. Shahryar offered advice to Virgil in the form of a story.
