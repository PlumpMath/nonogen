<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;That explains a lot.&quot;</p>
<p>Kublai Khan wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a twilit tetrasoon, accented by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of imbrication. Kublai Khan walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a neoclassic antechamber, watched over by a trompe-l'oeil fresco. Kublai Khan opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a primitive darbazi, tastefully offset by xoanon with a design of red gems. Kublai Khan felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a primitive darbazi, tastefully offset by xoanon with a design of red gems. And that was where the encounter between a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo took place. Kublai Khan offered advice to Marco Polo in the form of a story. So Kublai Khan began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Kublai Khan told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Kublai Khan said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan decided to travel onwards. Kublai Khan felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a marble-floored terrace, , within which was found a fountain. Kublai Khan chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a brick-walled spicery, accented by a wood-framed mirror with a design of taijitu. And that was where the encounter between a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad took place. Kublai Khan offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Kublai Khan began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<p id="kublai-khans-story-about-dunyazad-5">Kublai Khan's Story About Dunyazad</p>
<p>There was once an engmatic labyrinth just on the other side of the garden wall. Dunyazad wasn't quite sure where this was, only that she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a looming hedge maze, that had a moasic. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a primitive lumber room, dominated by a beautiful fresco framed by a pattern of red gems. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a looming atelier, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of scratched markings. Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a twilit colonnade, dominated by a fireplace with a design of imbrication. Dunyazad walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a brick-walled almonry, tastefully offset by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of taijitu. Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a archaic tetrasoon, tastefully offset by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of pearl inlay. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a Baroque tablinum, dominated by a curved staircase framed by a pattern of buta motifs. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a archaic terrace, watched over by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:</p>

<p>Dunyazad thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a looming hedge maze, that had a moasic. Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a philosopher named Socrates, a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo and a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri. Little Nemo suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Little Nemo told a very symbolic story. &quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Little Nemo said, ending his story.</p>

<p>Dunyazad entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu took place. Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>

<p>Kublai Khan entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Kublai Khan thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Kublai Khan opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;That was quite useless.&quot;</p>
<p>Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a art deco atrium, decorated with a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of blue stones. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a archaic triclinium, tastefully offset by a fire in a low basin framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. Dunyazad walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a luxurious cryptoporticus, containing an alcove. Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a Churrigueresque atelier, that had a cartouche with a mirror inside. And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo took place. Marco Polo offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Marco Polo began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Marco Polo told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Marco Polo said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Dunyazad decided to travel onwards. Dunyazad muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>

<p>Kublai Khan entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. And that was where the encounter between a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu took place. Kublai Khan offered advice to Murasaki Shikibu in the form of a story. So Kublai Khan began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri, the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a blind poet named Homer. Dunyazad suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Dunyazad told a very exciting story. Thus Dunyazad ended her 1st story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>
<p>So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>

<p>Shahryar entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>

<p>Virgil wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a ominous sudatorium, tastefully offset by a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a wide and low cavaedium, watched over by a curved staircase. Virgil muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a high fogou, accented by a crumbling mound of earth which was lined with a repeated pattern of a dizzying spiral pattern. Virgil thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. Virgil felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Virgil chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a luxurious atelier, that had a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing. Virgil discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. And there Virgil found the exit.</p>

<p>Shahryar decided to travel onwards. Shahryar wandered, lost in thought.</p>

<p>Shahryar entered a archaic still room, accented by a curved staircase framed by a pattern of pearl inlay.

So Shahryar began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<p id="shahryars-story-about-dante-alighieri-1">Shahryar's Story About Dante Alighieri</p>

<p>Dante Alighieri entered a wide and low cavaedium, watched over by a curved staircase. And that was where the encounter between a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Dante Alighieri offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Dante Alighieri began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Dante Alighieri told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Dante Alighieri said, ending the story.</p>

So Homer began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<p id="homers-story-about-virgil">Homer's Story About Virgil</p>
<p>There was once a twilight dimention in space from which few emerged. Virgil didn't know why he happened to be there. Virgil wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a wide and low atelier, accented by a glass chandelier which was lined with a repeated pattern of egg-and-dart. Virgil walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a rococo antechamber, dominated by a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of chevrons. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>

<p>Virgil entered a cramped and narrow still room, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of three hares. Virgil discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a marble-floored peristyle, dominated by a gilt-framed mirror with a design of complex interlacing. Virgil wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. And that was where the encounter between a poet of Rome named Virgil and a philosopher named Socrates took place.

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu. Perhaps there's a code.&quot;</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a twilit equatorial room, dominated by a crumbling mound of earth which was lined with a repeated pattern of imbrication. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Dante Alighieri muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. Dante Alighieri thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>

<p>Dante Alighieri entered a luxurious portico, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of arabseque. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. Almost unable to believe it, Dante Alighieri reached the end of the labyrinth.</p>

<p>Virgil decided to travel onwards. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>

<p>Virgil entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. And that was where the encounter between a poet of Rome named Virgil and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Virgil offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Virgil began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Virgil told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Virgil said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Virgil decided to travel onwards. Virgil felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>

<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a archaic hedge maze, watched over by a fountain. And that was where the encounter between a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a philosopher named Socrates took place. Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Socrates in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And she told the following story:</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu. Perhaps there's a code.&quot;</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri wandered, lost in thought.</p>

<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. And that was where the encounter between a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri took place. Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Dante Alighieri in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Murasaki Shikibu told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Murasaki Shikibu said, ending the story.</p>

And that was where the encounter between a king of Persia named Shahryar and a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan took place. Shahryar offered advice to Kublai Khan in the form of a story. So Shahryar began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu. Perhaps there's a code.&quot;</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu wandered, lost in thought.</p>

<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a high spicery, accented by a gilt-framed mirror with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Murasaki Shikibu muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>

<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Jorge Luis Borges said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges decided to travel onwards. Jorge Luis Borges felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>

So Jorge Luis Borges began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<p id="jorge-luis-borgess-story-about-virgil">Jorge Luis Borges's Story About Virgil</p>
<p>There was once a twilight dimention in space from which few emerged. Virgil didn't know why he happened to be there. Virgil wandered, lost in thought.</p>

<p>Asterion entered a art deco tetrasoon, decorated with a fallen column with a design of blue stones. Asterion walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Asterion entered a archaic cryptoporticus, decorated with a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of pearl inlay. Asterion opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Asterion entered a Churrigueresque atelier, watched over by moki steps. Asterion felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Asterion entered a Baroque cyzicene hall, , within which was found a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. Asterion muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened. At the darkest hour Asterion reached the end of the labyrinth.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Jorge Luis Borges said, ending his story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Asterion said, ending his story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Dante Alighieri said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri decided to travel onwards. Dante Alighieri walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a looming hedge maze, , within which was found a beautiful fresco. Dante Alighieri opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a high kiva, accented by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of a dizzying spiral pattern. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. And there Dante Alighieri reached the end of the labyrinth.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Jorge Luis Borges said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges decided to travel onwards. Jorge Luis Borges felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a wide and low cavaedium, tastefully offset by a moasic framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. Jorge Luis Borges muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a archaic atrium, accented by a fire in a low basin framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. And that was where the encounter between a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges and a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri took place. Jorge Luis Borges offered advice to Dante Alighieri in the form of a story. So Jorge Luis Borges began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Jorge Luis Borges told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Jorge Luis Borges said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges decided to travel onwards. Jorge Luis Borges felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Jorge Luis Borges chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. Quite unexpectedly Jorge Luis Borges discovered the way out.</p>

<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Kublai Khan said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Dunyazad decided to travel onwards. Dunyazad thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a looming hedge maze, that had a moasic. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a blind poet named Homer took place. Homer offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Homer began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<p id="homers-recursive-story-1">Homer's recursive Story</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer, a poet of Rome named Virgil and a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri. Virgil suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Virgil told a very exciting story. &quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Virgil said, ending his story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Homer said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Dunyazad decided to travel onwards. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a primitive colonnade, , within which was found a quatrefoil carved into the wall. Dunyazad muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a primitive peristyle, decorated with a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of red gems. Dunyazad thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. Quite unexpectedly Dunyazad found the exit.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Kublai Khan said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan decided to travel onwards. Kublai Khan felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Kublai Khan chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Kublai Khan discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a twilit cryptoporticus, containing a beautiful fresco. Kublai Khan wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>

<p>Kublai Khan entered a looming picture gallery, watched over by a false door. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:</p>

<p>Kublai Khan wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Kublai Khan walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. And that was where the encounter between a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu took place. Kublai Khan offered advice to Murasaki Shikibu in the form of a story. So Kublai Khan began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri, the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a blind poet named Homer. Dunyazad suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Dunyazad told a very exciting story. Thus Dunyazad ended her 1st story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>
<p>So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>
<p>This is the story that Dunyazad told:</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a king of Persia named Shahryar, a philosopher named Socrates and an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer. Socrates suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>

<p>Shahryar entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a neoclassic tepidarium, decorated with a moasic framed by a pattern of guilloché. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a twilit tetrasoon, accented by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of imbrication. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:</p>

<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a high picture gallery, watched over by a glass-framed mirror. Murasaki Shikibu muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a cramped and narrow still room, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of three hares. Murasaki Shikibu thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a primitive atelier, accented by xoanon with a design of red gems. Murasaki Shikibu felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Murasaki Shikibu chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a rococo atelier, accented by an alcove framed by a pattern of chevrons. Murasaki Shikibu discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a luxurious still room, containing divans lining the perimeter. Murasaki Shikibu opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Murasaki Shikibu felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. And that was where the encounter between a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a king of Persia named Shahryar took place. Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Shahryar in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And she told the following story:</p>
<p id="murasaki-shikibus-story-about-virgil-9">Murasaki Shikibu's Story About Virgil</p>
<p>There was once a twilight dimention in space from which few emerged. Virgil didn't know why he happened to be there. Virgil wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. Virgil walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a moasic framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a brick-walled picture gallery, tastefully offset by an exedra which was lined with a repeated pattern of taijitu. Virgil muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>

<p>Dante Alighieri entered a shadowy picture gallery, , within which was found a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. And that was where the encounter between a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Dante Alighieri offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Dante Alighieri began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Dante Alighieri told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Dante Alighieri said, ending the story.</p>

<p>Virgil wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a high fogou, containing a fallen column. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>

<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a archaic still room, accented by a curved staircase framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. And that was where the encounter between a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a philosopher named Socrates took place.

<p>And she told the following story:</p>
