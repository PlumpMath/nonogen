Marco Polo walked away from that place. 

Marco Polo entered a primitive peristyle, tastefully offset by a wood-framed mirror with a design of red gems. Marco Polo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.

##Scheherazade's Story About Homer

There was once a cybertextual data structure that was a map of itself. Homer had followed a secret path, and so he had arrived in that place. Homer walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Homer entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. Homer opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Homer entered a Baroque picture gallery, dominated by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of buta motifs. Homer felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Homer entered a archaic antechamber, , within which was found a cartouche with a mirror inside. And that was where the encounter between a blind poet named Homer and a poet of Rome named Virgil took place. Homer offered advice to Virgil in the form of a story. So Homer began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Homer told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Homer said, ending the story. 

Homer decided to travel onwards. Homer felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Homer entered a marble darbazi, , within which was found a fireplace. Homer chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Homer entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. And that was where the encounter between a blind poet named Homer and a queen of Persia named Scheherazade took place. Homer offered advice to Scheherazade in the form of a story.

And he told the following story:

---

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Homer said, ending the story. 

Homer decided to travel onwards. Homer discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Homer entered a primitive colonnade, , within which was found a quatrefoil carved into the wall. Homer opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Homer entered a Baroque cyzicene hall, , within which was found a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. Homer felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. At the darkest hour Homer reached the end of the labyrinth.

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..."

##Scheherazade's Story About Dunyazad

There was once an engmatic labyrinth, the place that can sometimes be glimpsed through mirrors. Dunyazad couldn't quite say how she was wandering there. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.

Dunyazad entered a cramped and narrow terrace, tastefully offset by a beautiful fresco framed by a pattern of three hares. Dunyazad thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 854th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

"Well," he said, "Maybe it's a clue to where the exit is."

Virgil wandered, lost in thought. Which was where Virgil reached the end of the labyrinth.

##Scheherazade's moving Story

Once upon a time, there was a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo, a queen of Persia named Scheherazade and a philosopher named Socrates. Scheherazade suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very convoluted story. Thus Scheherazade ended her 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

Once upon a time, there was a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri, a blind poet named Homer and a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo. Homer suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Homer told a very exciting story. "And that was how it happened," Homer said, ending his story.

This is the story that Geoffery Chaucer told:

############Geoffery Chaucer's Story About Dunyazad

There was once an engmatic labyrinth that had never known the light of the sun. Dunyazad couldn't quite say how she was wandering there. Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.

"And that was how it happened," Scheherazade said, ending her story.

"And that was how it happened," Murasaki Shikibu said, ending her story.

Dunyazad entered a rough library, that had xoanon. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a marble atrium, tastefully offset by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of palmettes. Dunyazad muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Dunyazad entered a ominous picture gallery, dominated by many solomonic columns which was lined with a repeated pattern of wooden carvings. Dunyazad thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Dunyazad entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. At the darkest hour Dunyazad reached the end of the labyrinth.

Dunyazad decided to travel onwards. Dunyazad walked away from that place. Quite unexpectedly Dunyazad discovered the way out.

"And that was how it happened," Murasaki Shikibu said, ending her story. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Asterion said, ending his story.

Once upon a time, there was the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad, a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a philosopher named Socrates.

"And that was how it happened," Dante Alighieri said, ending his story.

Dante Alighieri suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Dante Alighieri told a very touching story. "And that was how it happened," Dante Alighieri said, ending his story.

So Geoffery Chaucer began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

#########################Geoffery Chaucer's recursive Story

Once upon a time, there was a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges, a poet of Rome named Virgil and a philosopher named Socrates. Virgil suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Virgil told a very exciting story. Thus Virgil ended his 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Virgil told:


##########################Virgil's moving Story

Once upon a time, there was a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan, an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer and a blind poet named Homer.

"And that was how it happened," Geoffery Chaucer said, ending his story. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Virgil said, ending his story.

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Geoffery Chaucer said, ending the story. 

Geoffery Chaucer decided to travel onwards. Geoffery Chaucer muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Geoffery Chaucer entered a looming tablinum, that had a crumbling mound of earth. Geoffery Chaucer thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Geoffery Chaucer entered a rococo portico, accented by a fireplace with a design of chevrons. Geoffery Chaucer felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.

#########################Geoffery Chaucer's important Story

Once upon a time, there was an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo, a queen of Persia named Scheherazade and a blind poet named Homer.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:


##########################Scheherazade's inspiring Story

Once upon a time, there was a philosopher named Socrates, a blind poet named Homer and an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer. Homer suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Homer told:

###########################Homer's Story About Socrates

There was once a library that had never known the light of the sun. Socrates was almost certain about why he happened to be there. Socrates felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Socrates entered a cramped and narrow still room, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of three hares. Socrates walked away from that place. 

Socrates entered a high fogou, containing a fallen column. Socrates opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. At the darkest hour Socrates found the exit. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Homer said, ending his story. 

---

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Marco Polo said, ending the story. 

Marco Polo decided to travel onwards. Marco Polo felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Marco Polo entered a high portico, dominated by a fireplace with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Marco Polo chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Marco Polo entered a marble atelier, decorated with a false door framed by a pattern of palmettes. And that was where the encounter between an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo and a queen of Persia named Scheherazade took place. Marco Polo offered advice to Scheherazade in the form of a story. So Marco Polo began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Marco Polo told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Marco Polo said, ending the story. 

Marco Polo decided to travel onwards. Marco Polo wandered, lost in thought.

"Well," he said, "Maybe it's a clue to where the exit is."

Marco Polo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Marco Polo entered a high kiva, accented by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of a dizzying spiral pattern. Marco Polo felt sure that this must be the way out.

And he told the following story:

######################Marco Polo's important Story

Once upon a time, there was a philosopher named Socrates, a queen of Persia named Scheherazade and a king of Persia named Shahryar. Scheherazade suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very convoluted story. "And that was how it happened," Scheherazade said, ending her story.

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Marco Polo said, ending the story. 

Marco Polo decided to travel onwards. Marco Polo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror.

And he told the following story:

####################Marco Polo's important Story

Once upon a time, there was a philosopher named Socrates, a queen of Persia named Scheherazade and a king of Persia named Shahryar. Scheherazade suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very convoluted story. "And that was how it happened," Scheherazade said, ending her story.

Marco Polo decided to travel onwards. Marco Polo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror.

"And that was how it happened," Geoffery Chaucer said, ending his story.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

################Scheherazade's Story About Dunyazad

There was once a vast and perilous maze that was a map of itself. Dunyazad was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Dunyazad walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.

Thus Geoffery Chaucer ended his 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Geoffery Chaucer told:


################Geoffery Chaucer's inspiring Story

Once upon a time, there was the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad, a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a king of Persia named Shahryar. Murasaki Shikibu suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..."

#################Murasaki Shikibu's Story About Dunyazad

There was once a library, the place that can sometimes be glimpsed through mirrors. Dunyazad was almost certain about why she happened to be there. Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out.

And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Dunyazad offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Dunyazad began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And she told the following story:

###################Marco Polo's important Story

Once upon a time, there was a philosopher named Socrates, a queen of Persia named Scheherazade and a king of Persia named Shahryar. Scheherazade suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very convoluted story. "And that was how it happened," Scheherazade said, ending her story.

"And that was how it happened," Geoffery Chaucer said, ending his story.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

###############Scheherazade's Story About Dunyazad

There was once a vast and perilous maze that was a map of itself. Dunyazad was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Dunyazad walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a marble cavaedium, that had a parquet floor. Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror.

"Well," he said, "Maybe it's a clue to where the exit is."

Geoffery Chaucer thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Geoffery Chaucer entered a archaic still room, accented by a curved staircase framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. Geoffery Chaucer felt sure that this must be the way out.

Geoffery Chaucer offered advice to Murasaki Shikibu in the form of a story. So Geoffery Chaucer began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

##################Geoffery Chaucer's important Story

Once upon a time, there was a philosopher named Socrates, a queen of Persia named Scheherazade and a king of Persia named Shahryar. Scheherazade suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very convoluted story. "And that was how it happened," Scheherazade said, ending her story.

And that was where the encounter between an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo and a queen of Persia named Scheherazade took place. Marco Polo offered advice to Scheherazade in the form of a story. So Marco Polo began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Marco Polo told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Marco Polo said, ending the story. 

Marco Polo decided to travel onwards. Marco Polo wandered, lost in thought. 

Marco Polo entered a cramped and narrow atelier, tastefully offset by a beautiful fresco framed by a pattern of three hares. Marco Polo walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Marco Polo entered a archaic hall of doors, containing a koi pond. Marco Polo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Marco Polo entered a art deco atrium, accented by a stone-framed mirror which was lined with a repeated pattern of blue stones. Marco Polo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Marco Polo entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. Marco Polo felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Marco Polo entered a art deco lumber room, accented by a great many columns with a design of blue stones. Marco Polo chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Marco Polo entered a luxurious cryptoporticus, containing an alcove. Marco Polo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Marco Polo entered a Churrigueresque atelier, watched over by moki steps. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "Maybe it's a clue to where the exit is."

Marco Polo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Marco Polo entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. Marco Polo felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Marco Polo entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Marco Polo wandered, lost in thought.

Marco Polo entered a wide and low picture gallery, , within which was found a crumbling mound of earth. Marco Polo chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Marco Polo entered a rococo portico, accented by a glass chandelier which was lined with a repeated pattern of chevrons. Marco Polo walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Marco Polo entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. And that was where the encounter between an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu took place. Marco Polo offered advice to Murasaki Shikibu in the form of a story. So Marco Polo began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

####################Marco Polo's important Story

Once upon a time, there was a philosopher named Socrates, a queen of Persia named Scheherazade and a king of Persia named Shahryar. Scheherazade suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very convoluted story. "And that was how it happened," Scheherazade said, ending her story.

Marco Polo felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Marco Polo entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Marco Polo chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Marco Polo entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Marco Polo muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Marco Polo entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Marco Polo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Marco Polo entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Marco Polo felt sure that this must be the way out. Quite unexpectedly Marco Polo reached the end of the labyrinth.

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Dunyazad said, ending the story. 

Dunyazad decided to travel onwards. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. Which was where Dunyazad reached the end of the labyrinth. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Murasaki Shikibu said, ending her story. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Geoffery Chaucer said, ending his story.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

################Scheherazade's Story About Dunyazad

There was once a vast and perilous maze that was a map of itself. Dunyazad was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Dunyazad walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a ominous picture gallery, dominated by many solomonic columns which was lined with a repeated pattern of wooden carvings. Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a luxurious cryptoporticus, containing an alcove. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:
