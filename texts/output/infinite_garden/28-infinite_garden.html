And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a philosopher named Socrates took place. Dunyazad offered advice to Socrates in the form of a story. So Dunyazad began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Dunyazad told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Dunyazad said, ending the story.</p>

<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<p id="marco-polos-important-story">Marco Polo's important Story</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a philosopher named Socrates, a queen of Persia named Scheherazade and a king of Persia named Shahryar. Scheherazade suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Scheherazade told a very convoluted story. &quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Scheherazade said, ending her story.</p>

<p>Shahryar decided to travel onwards. Shahryar wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a brick-walled tetrasoon, decorated with a sipapu framed by a pattern of taijitu. Shahryar walked away from that place.</p>

<p>And she told the following story:</p>
<h3 id="scheherazades-moving-story-5">Scheherazade's moving Story</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, there was the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad, an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu. Geoffery Chaucer suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>
<p>This is the story that Geoffery Chaucer told:</p>
<h4 id="geoffery-chaucers-story-about-dunyazad-6">Geoffery Chaucer's Story About Dunyazad</h4>
<p>There was once an engmatic labyrinth that had never known the light of the sun. Dunyazad couldn't quite say how she was wandering there. Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a primitive cyzicene hall, that had a semi-dome. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a archaic still room, accented by a curved staircase framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a high triclinium, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Dunyazad walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a ominous sudatorium, tastefully offset by a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Dunyazad muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Dunyazad thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a ominous peristyle, that had a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing. Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a archaic twilit solar, , within which was found a lararium. Dunyazad walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a high fogou, containing a fallen column. Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. Quite unexpectedly Dunyazad discovered the way out.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Geoffery Chaucer said, ending his story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Scheherazade said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Shahryar decided to travel onwards. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Shahryar muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>

<p>So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>
<p>This is the story that Geoffery Chaucer told:</p>
<p id="geoffery-chaucers-story-about-kublai-khan">Geoffery Chaucer's Story About Kublai Khan</p>
<p>There was once a vast and perilous maze just on the other side of the garden wall. Kublai Khan couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Kublai Khan muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Kublai Khan thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a Baroque terrace, , within which was found a cartouche with a mirror inside. Kublai Khan felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Kublai Khan chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a cramped and narrow hall of doors, containing a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing. Kublai Khan walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Kublai Khan opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a marble hall of mirrors, , within which was found a fireplace. Kublai Khan felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a rough library, watched over by a lararium. And that was where the encounter between a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and a queen of Persia named Scheherazade took place. Kublai Khan offered advice to Scheherazade in the form of a story. So Kublai Khan began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges, a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a blind poet named Homer. Murasaki Shikibu suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>
<p>This is the story that Murasaki Shikibu told:</p>

<p>There was once an engmatic labyrinth that had never known the light of the sun. Geoffery Chaucer was almost certain about why he happened to be there. Geoffery Chaucer felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>

<p>Geoffery Chaucer entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Geoffery Chaucer walked away from that place. Quite unexpectedly Geoffery Chaucer discovered the way out.</p>

<p>&quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Murasaki Shikibu said, ending her story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Kublai Khan said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan decided to travel onwards. Kublai Khan thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a Churrigueresque spicery, dominated by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Kublai Khan felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a marble-floored tablinum, accented by a fountain framed by a pattern of complex interlacing. Kublai Khan chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a marble hall of mirrors, , within which was found a fireplace. Kublai Khan discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a ominous peristyle, that had a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing. Kublai Khan opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a primitive atelier, watched over by a fountain. Kublai Khan felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. Which was where Kublai Khan reached the end of the labyrinth.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Geoffery Chaucer said, ending his story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Socrates said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Socrates decided to travel onwards. Socrates walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a primitive colonnade, , within which was found a quatrefoil carved into the wall. Socrates opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a rough portico, watched over by a fountain. And that was where the encounter between a philosopher named Socrates and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Socrates offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Socrates began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Socrates told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Socrates said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Socrates decided to travel onwards. Socrates discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>

<p id="virgils-moving-story-6">Virgil's moving Story</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan, an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer and a blind poet named Homer. Geoffery Chaucer suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Geoffery Chaucer told a very convoluted story. &quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Geoffery Chaucer said, ending his story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Virgil said, ending his story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Kublai Khan said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan decided to travel onwards. Kublai Khan muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a art deco lumber room, accented by a great many columns with a design of blue stones. Kublai Khan thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Kublai Khan felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a rococo colonnade, , within which was found a monolith. Kublai Khan chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a rococo picture gallery, dominated by a sipapu framed by a pattern of chevrons. Kublai Khan discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a Churrigueresque spicery, dominated by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Kublai Khan wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a wide and low cavaedium, watched over by a curved staircase. Kublai Khan walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a Churrigueresque atelier, watched over by moki steps. Kublai Khan muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a luxurious library, watched over by a gilt-framed mirror. And that was where the encounter between a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad took place. Kublai Khan offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Kublai Khan began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>

<p>Socrates entered a archaic liwan, dominated by many solomonic columns which was lined with a repeated pattern of pearl inlay. Socrates chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a cramped and narrow still room, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of three hares.

<p>Geoffery Chaucer thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror.</p>

And that was where the encounter between a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and a poet of Rome named Virgil took place. Kublai Khan offered advice to Virgil in the form of a story. So Kublai Khan began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
