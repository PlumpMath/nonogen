"Well," he said, "Perhaps it's a list of names? Or a crossword puzzle that was filled in wrong. Perhaps there's a code."

Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dante Alighieri entered a rococo tablinum, watched over by a cartouche with a mirror inside. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a Churrigueresque hedge maze, , within which was found a fire in a low basin. Dante Alighieri chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dante Alighieri entered a wide and low lumber room, that had a great many columns. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Dante Alighieri thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Dante Alighieri entered a high kiva, accented by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of a dizzying spiral pattern. Dante Alighieri discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Dante Alighieri entered a neoclassic hedge maze, dominated by a fallen column with a design of guilloché. And that was where the encounter between a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Dante Alighieri offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Dante Alighieri began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Dante Alighieri told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Dante Alighieri said, ending the story. 

Dante Alighieri decided to travel onwards. Dante Alighieri wandered, lost in thought. 

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps. Which was where Dante Alighieri reached the end of the labyrinth.

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Virgil said, ending the story. 

Virgil decided to travel onwards. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Virgil entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Virgil muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.

"Well," he said, "Perhaps it's a list of names? Or a crossword puzzle that was filled in wrong. Perhaps there's a code."

Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dante Alighieri entered a high rotunda, decorated with a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Dante Alighieri chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a primitive tepidarium, that had a lararium. Dante Alighieri opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.

Dante Alighieri entered a marble-floored cyzicene hall, , within which was found a sipapu. Dante Alighieri discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. And that was where the encounter between a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Dante Alighieri offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Dante Alighieri began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Dante Alighieri told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Dante Alighieri said, ending the story. 

Dante Alighieri decided to travel onwards. Dante Alighieri wandered, lost in thought. 

Dante Alighieri entered a neoclassic hall of doors, tastefully offset by a cartouche with a mirror inside framed by a pattern of guilloché. Dante Alighieri walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps.

#########Kublai Khan's inspiring Story

Once upon a time, there was a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu, a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan.

Little Nemo entered a looming atelier, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of scratched markings. Little Nemo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.

Once upon a time, there was a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri, a poet of Rome named Virgil and an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo. Virgil suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Virgil told a very touching story. "And that was how it happened," Virgil said, ending his story.

##Scheherazade's Story About Shahryar

There was once a mysterious labyrinth that lived in eternal twilight. Shahryar couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Shahryar walked away from that place. 

Shahryar entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "Somehow, it reminds me of tigers. Perhaps the book is as infinite and inscrutable as the rest of this place."

Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Shahryar entered a luxurious liwan, watched over by a lararium. Shahryar discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Shahryar entered a Baroque terrace, , within which was found a cartouche with a mirror inside. Shahryar wandered, lost in thought. 

Shahryar entered a archaic almonry, , within which was found a wood-framed mirror. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Shahryar entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Shahryar muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Shahryar entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Shahryar entered a primitive colonnade, , within which was found a quatrefoil carved into the wall. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "That was quite useless."

Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Shahryar entered a luxurious portico, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of arabseque. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out. Which was where Shahryar found the exit.

##Scheherazade's Story About Little Nemo

There was once a recursive house of many doors that lived in eternal twilight. Little Nemo wasn't quite sure where this was, only that he had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Little Nemo felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Little Nemo entered a high tablinum, containing a cartouche with a mirror inside. Little Nemo muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Little Nemo entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Little Nemo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Little Nemo entered a art deco rotunda, accented by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of blue stones. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

#####Virgil's Story About Little Nemo

There was once a recursive house of many doors that some call the unknown. Little Nemo was almost certain about why he happened to be there. Little Nemo felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Little Nemo entered a looming atelier, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of scratched markings. Little Nemo chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Little Nemo entered a Baroque hall of mirrors, decorated with a glass-framed mirror framed by a pattern of buta motifs. Little Nemo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Little Nemo entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Little Nemo felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.

Little Nemo entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Little Nemo wandered, lost in thought. 

Little Nemo entered a high portico, decorated with a great many columns with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Little Nemo walked away from that place. 

Little Nemo entered a shadowy tetrasoon, watched over by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing. Little Nemo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Little Nemo entered a brick-walled cryptoporticus, that had a great many columns. Little Nemo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Little Nemo entered a Baroque cyzicene hall, , within which was found a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. And that was where the encounter between a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad took place. Little Nemo offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Little Nemo began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Little Nemo told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Little Nemo said, ending the story. 

Little Nemo decided to travel onwards. Little Nemo felt sure that this must be the way out. Quite unexpectedly Little Nemo reached the end of the labyrinth.

"Well," he said, "That was quite useless."

Shahryar discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Shahryar entered a twilit tetrasoon, accented by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of imbrication. Shahryar wandered, lost in thought. 

Shahryar entered a high triclinium, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Shahryar walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Shahryar entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Shahryar muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. Almost unable to believe it, Shahryar discovered the way out.

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

##Scheherazade's Story About Little Nemo

There was once a twisted garden from which few emerged. Little Nemo must have spoken the unutterable word, because he had arrived in that place. Little Nemo muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Little Nemo entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "Perhaps it's a list of names? Or a crossword puzzle that was filled in wrong."

Little Nemo walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Little Nemo entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Little Nemo muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Little Nemo entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. And that was where the encounter between a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo and a king of Persia named Shahryar took place. Little Nemo offered advice to Shahryar in the form of a story. So Little Nemo began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

###Little Nemo's inspiring Story

Once upon a time, there was a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri, an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad. Marco Polo suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Marco Polo told a very symbolic story. Thus Marco Polo ended his 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Marco Polo told:


####Marco Polo's amusing Story

Once upon a time, there was a king of Persia named Shahryar, a member of royalty named Asterion and a queen of Persia named Scheherazade. Asterion suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Asterion told:

#####Asterion's Story About Shahryar

There was once a recursive house of many doors, which is the world. Shahryar couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Shahryar entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Shahryar entered a rococo hall of doors, that had a fireplace. Shahryar discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Shahryar entered a rococo hall of doors, that had a fireplace. Shahryar walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps.

"Well," he said, "That was quite useless."

Shahryar discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Shahryar entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Shahryar wandered, lost in thought. 

Shahryar entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. Shahryar walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Shahryar entered a marble picture gallery, that had an abat-son. Shahryar muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Shahryar entered a rough kiva, containing a cartouche with a mirror inside. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Shahryar entered a looming spicery, , within which was found an alcove. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Shahryar entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "Maybe it's a clue to where the exit is. Perhaps there's a code."

Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Shahryar entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Shahryar muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Shahryar entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Shahryar entered a primitive colonnade, , within which was found a quatrefoil carved into the wall. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Shahryar entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. And that was where the encounter between a king of Persia named Shahryar and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu took place. Shahryar offered advice to Murasaki Shikibu in the form of a story. So Shahryar began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Shahryar told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Shahryar said, ending the story. 

Shahryar decided to travel onwards. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. At the darkest hour Shahryar found the exit.

"And that was how it happened," Asterion said, ending his story.

"And that was how it happened," Marco Polo said, ending his story.

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Little Nemo said, ending the story. 

Little Nemo decided to travel onwards. Little Nemo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Little Nemo entered a wide and low portico, watched over by an abat-son. Little Nemo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Little Nemo entered a archaic still room, containing a beautiful fresco. Little Nemo felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Little Nemo entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Little Nemo muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Little Nemo entered a neoclassic almonry, accented by a quatrefoil carved into the wall with a design of guilloché. Little Nemo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Little Nemo entered a art deco peristyle, watched over by a parquet floor. Little Nemo felt sure that this must be the way out. Which was where Little Nemo reached the end of the labyrinth.

"Well," she said, "Maybe it's a clue to where the exit is. Perhaps there's a code."

Scheherazade felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Scheherazade entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Scheherazade muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Scheherazade entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. Scheherazade thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Scheherazade entered a luxurious darbazi, dominated by xoanon with a design of arabseque. Scheherazade felt sure that this must be the way out. And there Scheherazade found the exit.

"And that was how it happened," Homer said, ending his story. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Jorge Luis Borges said, ending his story. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Asterion said, ending his story.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 152nd story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

##Scheherazade's Story About Dante Alighieri

There was once an architectural forest from which few emerged. Dante Alighieri had followed a secret path, and so he had arrived in that place. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Dante Alighieri thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Dante Alighieri entered a Baroque picture gallery, dominated by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of buta motifs. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "That was quite useless."

Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a high tablinum, containing a cartouche with a mirror inside. Dante Alighieri thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Dante Alighieri entered a marble darbazi, , within which was found a fireplace. And that was where the encounter between a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Dante Alighieri offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Dante Alighieri began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Dante Alighieri told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Dante Alighieri said, ending the story. 

Dante Alighieri decided to travel onwards. Dante Alighieri chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Dante Alighieri entered a cramped and narrow peristyle, dominated by a koi pond which was lined with a repeated pattern of three hares. Dante Alighieri wandered, lost in thought. 

Dante Alighieri entered a shadowy cyzicene hall, , within which was found many solomonic columns. Dante Alighieri walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. Almost unable to believe it, Dante Alighieri discovered the way out.

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

##Scheherazade's Story About Shahryar

There was once a recursive house of many doors, which is the world. Shahryar couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Shahryar entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Shahryar entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Shahryar discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Shahryar entered a luxurious cryptoporticus, containing an alcove. Shahryar walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Shahryar entered a luxurious cryptoporticus, containing an alcove. Shahryar opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.

Shahryar entered a high picture gallery, watched over by a glass-framed mirror. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Shahryar entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "That was quite useless."

Virgil chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Virgil entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Virgil discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Virgil entered a cramped and narrow fogou, watched over by a monolith. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. Which was where Virgil found the exit. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Jorge Luis Borges said, ending his story. 

---

Thus Scheherazade ended her 163rd story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

##Scheherazade's Story About Asterion

There was once a twilight dimention in space from which few emerged. Asterion was lost, like so many before and after, and he had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Asterion chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Asterion entered a Baroque picture gallery, dominated by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of buta motifs. Asterion walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Asterion entered a twilit fogou, decorated with a koi pond which was lined with a repeated pattern of imbrication. Asterion opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Asterion entered a marble sudatorium, dominated by an abat-son with a design of palmettes. Asterion felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Asterion entered a rough tablinum, that had a parquet floor. Asterion muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Asterion entered a wide and low kiva, that had a false door. Asterion thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Asterion entered a marble atrium, accented by a koi pond which was lined with a repeated pattern of palmettes. Asterion opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Asterion entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. Asterion felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Asterion entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Asterion muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Asterion entered a art deco rotunda, accented by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of blue stones. Asterion thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Asterion entered a marble hall of mirrors, accented by a false door framed by a pattern of palmettes. Asterion felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Asterion entered a marble hall of mirrors, accented by a false door framed by a pattern of palmettes. Asterion chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Asterion entered a luxurious portico, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of arabseque. Asterion discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. And there Asterion discovered the way out.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 164th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very touching story. Thus Scheherazade ended her 165th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:


##Scheherazade's amusing Story

Once upon a time, there was a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo, the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a king of Persia named Shahryar. Dunyazad suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Dunyazad told:

###Dunyazad's Story About Murasaki Shikibu

There was once a recursive house of many doors, which is the world. Murasaki Shikibu was almost certain about why she happened to be there. Murasaki Shikibu felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a looming tetrasoon, containing a wood-framed mirror. Murasaki Shikibu muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Murasaki Shikibu thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

"Well," she said, "Maybe it's a clue to where the exit is."

Murasaki Shikibu opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Murasaki Shikibu felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a marble-floored darbazi, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of complex interlacing. Murasaki Shikibu felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a looming tetrasoon, containing a wood-framed mirror. Murasaki Shikibu chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a brick-walled anatomical theatre, dominated by a pair of komaninu with a design of taijitu. Murasaki Shikibu felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Murasaki Shikibu chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a cramped and narrow cryptoporticus, containing a sipapu. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

"Well," she said, "Maybe it's a clue to where the exit is, or maybe it was written upside down."

Murasaki Shikibu muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a shadowy picture gallery, accented by moki steps which was lined with a repeated pattern of carved runes. Murasaki Shikibu chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a brick-walled cavaedium, watched over by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. And that was where the encounter between a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad took place. Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And she told the following story:

####Murasaki Shikibu's moving Story

Once upon a time, there was a blind poet named Homer, a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo. Dante Alighieri suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Dante Alighieri told a very symbolic story. "And that was how it happened," Dante Alighieri said, ending his story. 

---

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Murasaki Shikibu said, ending the story. 

Murasaki Shikibu decided to travel onwards. Murasaki Shikibu discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a looming tetrasoon, containing a wood-framed mirror. Murasaki Shikibu wandered, lost in thought. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a archaic cavaedium, watched over by a sipapu. Murasaki Shikibu felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Murasaki Shikibu muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a high fogou, containing a fallen column. Murasaki Shikibu thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. And there Murasaki Shikibu found the exit. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Dunyazad said, ending her story. 

---

Thus Scheherazade ended her 166th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:


##Scheherazade's important Story

Once upon a time, there was a member of royalty named Asterion, a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a king of Persia named Shahryar. Murasaki Shikibu suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Murasaki Shikibu told a very convoluted story. Thus Murasaki Shikibu ended her 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Murasaki Shikibu told:


###Murasaki Shikibu's complex Story

Once upon a time, there was a poet of Rome named Virgil, a queen of Persia named Scheherazade and a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri. Scheherazade suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

####Scheherazade's Story About Socrates

There was once a vast and perilous maze that was a map of itself. Socrates couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Socrates walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Socrates entered a neoclassic liwan, tastefully offset by moki steps which was lined with a repeated pattern of guilloché. Socrates opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Socrates entered a twilit equatorial room, dominated by a crumbling mound of earth which was lined with a repeated pattern of imbrication. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "That was quite useless."

Jorge Luis Borges thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a marble-floored antechamber, decorated with a monolith which was lined with a repeated pattern of complex interlacing. Jorge Luis Borges felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Jorge Luis Borges chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Jorge Luis Borges walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a twilit kiva, containing a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. Jorge Luis Borges opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. Jorge Luis Borges felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a Churrigueresque atelier, watched over by moki steps. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

Jorge Luis Borges felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a marble almonry, decorated with a fountain framed by a pattern of palmettes. Jorge Luis Borges chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. And there Jorge Luis Borges discovered the way out.

Socrates entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Socrates felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Socrates entered a rococo triclinium, , within which was found a pair of komaninu. Socrates wandered, lost in thought. 

Socrates entered a rough hall of mirrors, accented by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of acanthus. Socrates walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Socrates entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Socrates opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Socrates entered a Churrigueresque atrium, , within which was found divans lining the perimeter. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

And that was where the encounter between a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo took place. Kublai Khan offered advice to Little Nemo in the form of a story. So Kublai Khan began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

Once upon a time, there was a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges, a poet of Rome named Virgil and an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo.

Thus Jorge Luis Borges ended his 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Jorge Luis Borges told:

"Well," he said, "Somehow, it reminds me of tigers, or maybe it was written upside down."

Jorge Luis Borges walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a ominous lumber room, decorated with an obelisk with a design of wooden carvings. Jorge Luis Borges chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. Which was where Jorge Luis Borges discovered the way out.

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Kublai Khan said, ending the story. 

Kublai Khan decided to travel onwards. Kublai Khan felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Kublai Khan entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Kublai Khan muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Kublai Khan entered a rococo triclinium, , within which was found a pair of komaninu. Kublai Khan thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Kublai Khan entered a primitive cyzicene hall, watched over by a moasic. Kublai Khan felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Kublai Khan entered a archaic atelier, tastefully offset by an alcove framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. Kublai Khan wandered, lost in thought. 

Kublai Khan entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Kublai Khan walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Kublai Khan entered a high spicery, accented by a gilt-framed mirror with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Kublai Khan opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Kublai Khan entered a twilit tepidarium, tastefully offset by moki steps which was lined with a repeated pattern of imbrication. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "That explains a lot."

Kublai Khan discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. Almost unable to believe it, Kublai Khan found the exit.

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Socrates said, ending the story. 

Socrates decided to travel onwards. Socrates wandered, lost in thought. 

Socrates entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Socrates walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Socrates entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Socrates opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Socrates entered a marble atrium, accented by a koi pond which was lined with a repeated pattern of palmettes. Socrates felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.

This is the story that Murasaki Shikibu told:


###Murasaki Shikibu's inspiring Story

Once upon a time, there was an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer, a poet of Rome named Virgil and an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo. Virgil suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Virgil told:

####Virgil's Story About Kublai Khan

There was once an engmatic labyrinth that was a map of itself. Kublai Khan didn't know why he happened to be there. Kublai Khan felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Kublai Khan entered a neoclassic liwan, tastefully offset by moki steps which was lined with a repeated pattern of guilloché. Kublai Khan muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Kublai Khan entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Kublai Khan thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Kublai Khan entered a Churrigueresque spicery, dominated by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Kublai Khan felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Kublai Khan entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

And he told the following story:

Once upon a time, there was a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges, a poet of Rome named Virgil and an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo. Jorge Luis Borges suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Jorge Luis Borges told a very convoluted story.

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Homer said, ending the story. 

Homer decided to travel onwards. Homer wandered, lost in thought. 

Homer entered a high portico, decorated with a great many columns with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Homer walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Homer entered a Churrigueresque library, accented by a lararium which was lined with a repeated pattern of winding knots. Homer opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Homer entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Homer felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Homer entered a brick-walled kiva, watched over by a monolith. Homer muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. Quite unexpectedly Homer discovered the way out.

"And that was how it happened," Socrates said, ending his story.

##Scheherazade's Story About Homer

There was once an engmatic labyrinth that was a map of itself. Homer must have gotten lost, because he was wandering there. Homer chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Homer entered a cramped and narrow terrace, tastefully offset by a beautiful fresco framed by a pattern of three hares. Homer discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Homer entered a luxurious cryptoporticus, containing an alcove. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "Somehow, it reminds me of tigers."

Homer thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Homer entered a high portico, decorated with a great many columns with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Homer discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Homer entered a high fogou, containing a fallen column. And that was where the encounter between a blind poet named Homer and a king of Persia named Shahryar took place. Homer offered advice to Shahryar in the form of a story. So Homer began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Homer told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Homer said, ending the story. 

Homer decided to travel onwards. Homer wandered, lost in thought. Quite unexpectedly Homer reached the end of the labyrinth.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 173rd story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

##Scheherazade's Story About Socrates

There was once an expansive zone, the place that can sometimes be glimpsed through mirrors. Socrates was almost certain about why he happened to be there. Socrates wandered, lost in thought. 

Socrates entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. Socrates walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Socrates entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. Socrates opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Socrates entered a cramped and narrow terrace, tastefully offset by a beautiful fresco framed by a pattern of three hares. Socrates felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Socrates entered a archaic still room, accented by a curved staircase framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "That was quite useless. I hope that it's not important, because I can't read it."

Socrates wandered, lost in thought. 

Socrates entered a twilit tetrasoon, accented by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of imbrication. Socrates felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Socrates entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. And that was where the encounter between a philosopher named Socrates and an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo took place. Socrates offered advice to Marco Polo in the form of a story. So Socrates began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

###Socrates's Story About Kublai Khan

There was once an engmatic labyrinth that was a map of itself. Kublai Khan didn't know why he happened to be there. Kublai Khan wandered, lost in thought. 

Kublai Khan entered a rococo equatorial room, that had a semi-dome. Kublai Khan walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Kublai Khan entered a primitive tepidarium, that had a lararium. Kublai Khan opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror.

And he told the following story:

####Kublai Khan's Story About Socrates

There was once an expansive zone that was a map of itself. Socrates was lost, like so many before and after, and he had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Socrates walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Socrates entered a wide and low tablinum, watched over by a trompe-l'oeil fresco. Socrates chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Socrates entered a archaic atelier, , within which was found a monolith. Socrates discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Socrates entered a marble anatomical theatre, decorated with a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of palmettes. Socrates wandered, lost in thought. 

Socrates entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. Socrates walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. Almost unable to believe it, Socrates discovered the way out.

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Kublai Khan said, ending the story. 

Kublai Khan decided to travel onwards. Kublai Khan walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.

And he told the following story:

#####Homer's complex Story

Once upon a time, there was a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges, a poet of Rome named Virgil and an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo. Jorge Luis Borges suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Jorge Luis Borges told a very convoluted story. Thus Jorge Luis Borges ended his 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Jorge Luis Borges told:

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Homer said, ending the story. 

Homer decided to travel onwards. Homer felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Homer entered a marble hall of mirrors, accented by a false door framed by a pattern of palmettes. Homer muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.

Kublai Khan entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Kublai Khan walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Kublai Khan entered a shadowy picture gallery, , within which was found a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. And that was where the encounter between a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo took place. Kublai Khan offered advice to Little Nemo in the form of a story. So Kublai Khan began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

####Kublai Khan's complex Story

Once upon a time, there was a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges, a poet of Rome named Virgil and an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo. Jorge Luis Borges suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Jorge Luis Borges told a very convoluted story. Thus Jorge Luis Borges ended his 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Jorge Luis Borges told:

Kublai Khan decided to travel onwards. Kublai Khan felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Kublai Khan entered a rococo terrace, accented by a wood-framed mirror with a design of chevrons. Kublai Khan muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.

"Well," he said, "That explains a lot."

Kublai Khan discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Kublai Khan entered a primitive colonnade, , within which was found a quatrefoil carved into the wall. Kublai Khan wandered, lost in thought. And there Kublai Khan reached the end of the labyrinth.

Socrates entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Socrates muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Socrates entered a cramped and narrow fogou, watched over by a monolith. Socrates thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Socrates entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Socrates felt sure that this must be the way out. Which was where Socrates found the exit.

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:


##Scheherazade's inspiring Story

Once upon a time, there was a blind poet named Homer, a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges. Little Nemo suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Little Nemo told a very symbolic story. "And that was how it happened," Little Nemo said, ending his story.

##Scheherazade's Story About Dunyazad

There was once a library that was a map of itself. Dunyazad must have gotten lost, because she was wandering there. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought.

Homer entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Homer walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Homer entered a cramped and narrow fogou, watched over by a monolith. Homer opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. And there Homer found the exit.
