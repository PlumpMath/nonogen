<p>Geoffery Chaucer walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>

<p>Geoffery Chaucer entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Geoffery Chaucer felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Geoffery Chaucer entered a primitive atelier, watched over by a fountain. Geoffery Chaucer chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. Quite unexpectedly Geoffery Chaucer discovered the way out.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Scheherazade said, ending her story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Dunyazad said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Dunyazad decided to travel onwards. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Dunyazad walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a rough spicery, decorated with a fire in a low basin framed by a pattern of acanthus. Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a Baroque still room, tastefully offset by a false door framed by a pattern of buta motifs. Dunyazad thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a archaic triclinium, tastefully offset by a fire in a low basin framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>

<p>Dunyazad entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a brick-walled picture gallery, watched over by a parquet floor. And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a member of royalty named Asterion took place. Asterion offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Asterion began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<p id="asterions-story-about-jorge-luis-borges-1">Asterion's Story About Jorge Luis Borges</p>
<p>There was once a vast and perilous maze that had never known the light of the sun. Jorge Luis Borges was almost certain about why he happened to be there. Jorge Luis Borges felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>

<p>Dunyazad entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a poet of Rome named Virgil took place. Virgil offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story.

<p>There was once a vast and perilous maze that had never known the light of the sun. Jorge Luis Borges was almost certain about why he happened to be there. Jorge Luis Borges felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a Churrigueresque atelier, watched over by moki steps. Jorge Luis Borges wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Jorge Luis Borges walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a neoclassic sudatorium, dominated by a moasic framed by a pattern of guilloché. Jorge Luis Borges opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Jorge Luis Borges felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. And there Jorge Luis Borges found the exit.</p>

<p>Geoffery Chaucer entered a brick-walled picture gallery, watched over by a parquet floor. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:</p>

<p>Thus Scheherazade ended her 590th story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>

<p>There was once an engmatic labyrinth just on the other side of the garden wall. Marco Polo didn't know why he happened to be there. Marco Polo wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a luxurious spicery, watched over by a fallen column. Marco Polo walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a twilit fogou, decorated with a koi pond which was lined with a repeated pattern of imbrication. Marco Polo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, , within which was found a pair of komaninu. And that was where the encounter between an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo and a queen of Persia named Scheherazade took place. Marco Polo offered advice to Scheherazade in the form of a story. So Marco Polo began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
