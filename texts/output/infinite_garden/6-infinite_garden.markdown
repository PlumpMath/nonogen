#The Infinite Garden of One Thousand and One Stories

Jorge Luis Borges decided to travel onwards. Jorge Luis Borges felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a primitive terrace, decorated with an abat-son with a design of red gems. Jorge Luis Borges muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. And that was where the encounter between a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges and a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan took place. Jorge Luis Borges offered advice to Kublai Khan in the form of a story. So Jorge Luis Borges began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Jorge Luis Borges told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Jorge Luis Borges said, ending the story. 

Jorge Luis Borges decided to travel onwards. Jorge Luis Borges felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a marble-floored library, decorated with a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of complex interlacing. Jorge Luis Borges chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a archaic still room, accented by a curved staircase framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. Jorge Luis Borges discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a rococo triclinium, , within which was found a pair of komaninu. Jorge Luis Borges wandered, lost in thought. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a Churrigueresque spicery, dominated by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Jorge Luis Borges felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a rough triclinium, decorated with an obelisk with a design of acanthus. Jorge Luis Borges muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Jorge Luis Borges thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a cramped and narrow still room, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of three hares. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

###Dunyazad's Story About Dunyazad

There was once an expansive zone, the place that can sometimes be glimpsed through mirrors. Dunyazad couldn't quite say how she was wandering there. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a high picture gallery, , within which was found a lararium. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

Kublai Khan entered a cramped and narrow still room, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of three hares. Kublai Khan felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Kublai Khan entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Kublai Khan muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Kublai Khan entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Kublai Khan chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Kublai Khan entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Kublai Khan discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Kublai Khan entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Kublai Khan wandered, lost in thought.

"Well," he said, "I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu. I hope that it's not important, because I can't read it."

Kublai Khan wandered, lost in thought. 

Kublai Khan entered a Churrigueresque spicery, dominated by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Kublai Khan walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Kublai Khan entered a rococo picture gallery, dominated by a sipapu framed by a pattern of chevrons. Kublai Khan muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Kublai Khan entered a marble tablinum, containing moki steps. Kublai Khan thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Kublai Khan entered a brick-walled almonry, tastefully offset by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of taijitu. Kublai Khan felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Kublai Khan entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Kublai Khan chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Kublai Khan entered a ominous peristyle, that had a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing. Kublai Khan discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. Quite unexpectedly Kublai Khan found the exit.

##Scheherazade's Story About Homer

There was once a vast and perilous maze that was a map of itself. Homer was lost, like so many before and after, and he had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Homer muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Homer entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "Perhaps it's a list of names? Or a crossword puzzle that was filled in wrong. I hope that it's not important, because I can't read it."

Homer felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Homer entered a high picture gallery, watched over by a glass-framed mirror. Homer muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Homer entered a luxurious spicery, watched over by a fallen column. And that was where the encounter between a blind poet named Homer and a member of royalty named Asterion took place. Homer offered advice to Asterion in the form of a story. So Homer began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Homer told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Homer said, ending the story. 

Homer decided to travel onwards. Homer felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Homer entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Homer chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Homer entered a Baroque terrace, , within which was found a cartouche with a mirror inside. Homer discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Homer entered a marble atrium, accented by a koi pond which was lined with a repeated pattern of palmettes. Homer wandered, lost in thought. 

Homer entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Homer felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Homer entered a rough triclinium, decorated with an obelisk with a design of acanthus. Homer muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Homer entered a archaic equatorial room, accented by an abat-son with a design of pearl inlay. Homer thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Homer entered a archaic still room, containing a beautiful fresco. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "It is as confusing as this maze."

Homer opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Homer entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Homer felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Homer entered a primitive colonnade, accented by an obelisk with a design of red gems. Homer muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. Quite unexpectedly Homer discovered the way out.

##Scheherazade's Story About Marco Polo

There was once a vast and perilous maze that was a map of itself. Marco Polo had followed a secret path, and so he had arrived in that place. Marco Polo chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Marco Polo entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. Marco Polo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Marco Polo entered a twilit almonry, watched over by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing. Marco Polo wandered, lost in thought. 

Marco Polo entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. Marco Polo felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Marco Polo entered a wide and low lumber room, that had a great many columns. Marco Polo muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Marco Polo entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Marco Polo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Marco Polo entered a marble hall of mirrors, accented by a false door framed by a pattern of palmettes. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "It is as confusing as this maze."

Marco Polo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Marco Polo entered a primitive peristyle, decorated with a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of red gems. Marco Polo felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Marco Polo entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Marco Polo muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. Quite unexpectedly Marco Polo discovered the way out.

##Scheherazade's Story About Socrates

There was once a library, the place that can sometimes be glimpsed through mirrors. Socrates was almost certain about why he happened to be there. Socrates wandered, lost in thought. 

Socrates entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Socrates walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.

Socrates entered a archaic still room, accented by a curved staircase framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. Socrates muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Socrates entered a high terrace, watched over by a trompe-l'oeil fresco. Socrates chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Socrates entered a ominous antechamber, containing an obelisk. Socrates discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Socrates entered a brick-walled tablinum, accented by a fireplace with a design of taijitu. Socrates wandered, lost in thought. 

Socrates entered a art deco rotunda, accented by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of blue stones. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Scheherazade told a very exciting story. Thus Scheherazade ended her 328th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:


##Scheherazade's moving Story

Once upon a time, there was an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo, a blind poet named Homer and an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer. Homer suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Homer told a very convoluted story. "And that was how it happened," Homer said, ending his story.

Socrates entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Socrates felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Socrates entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:
