<p>Homer entered a twilit twilit solar, dominated by a stone-framed mirror which was lined with a repeated pattern of imbrication. Homer muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Homer entered a primitive tetrasoon, that had a wood-framed mirror. Homer thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>

<p>Homer entered a Churrigueresque atelier, watched over by moki steps. And that was where the encounter between a blind poet named Homer and a member of royalty named Asterion took place. Homer offered advice to Asterion in the form of a story. So Homer began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu, a member of royalty named Asterion and a king of Persia named Shahryar. Asterion suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Asterion told a very exciting story. Thus Asterion ended his 1st story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a member of royalty named Asterion, a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu. Little Nemo suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>

<p id="little-nemos-story-about-shahryar">Little Nemo's Story About Shahryar</p>
<p>There was once a mysterious labyrinth that some call the unknown. Shahryar couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Shahryar wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Shahryar walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a marble atelier, containing a sipapu. Shahryar opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a high kiva, accented by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of a dizzying spiral pattern. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. Shahryar muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a shadowy picture gallery, accented by moki steps which was lined with a repeated pattern of carved runes. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a ominous colonnade, tastefully offset by a gilt-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Shahryar discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Shahryar wandered, lost in thought.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a member of royalty named Asterion, a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu.

<p>Shahryar entered a marble-floored darbazi, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of complex interlacing. Shahryar walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a twilit cavaedium, containing a standing stone inlayed with gold and. Shahryar opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a luxurious kiva, dominated by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of arabseque. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a brick-walled cavaedium, watched over by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. Shahryar muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a primitive sudatorium, accented by a koi pond which was lined with a repeated pattern of red gems. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a brick-walled hall of doors, watched over by a fireplace. Shahryar discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>

<p>Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>

<p>Virgil wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Virgil walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a rococo picture gallery, dominated by a sipapu framed by a pattern of chevrons. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>

<p>There was once a twisted garden that lived in eternal twilight. Virgil was lost, like so many before and after, and he had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Virgil chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>

<p>There was once a twisted garden that lived in eternal twilight. Asterion must have spoken the unutterable word, because he had arrived in that place. Asterion muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Asterion entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. Asterion walked away from that place.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a member of royalty named Asterion, the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo. Dunyazad suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Dunyazad told a very symbolic story.

<p>There was once an architectural forest, which is the world. Shahryar had followed a secret path, and so he had arrived in that place. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a high twilit solar, tastefully offset by a curved staircase framed by a pattern of a dizzying spiral pattern. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Shahryar discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. Shahryar opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a Churrigueresque atelier, watched over by moki steps. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Shahryar muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a archaic atrium, accented by a fire in a low basin framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. And that was where the encounter between a king of Persia named Shahryar and a member of royalty named Asterion took place. Shahryar offered advice to Asterion in the form of a story. So Shahryar began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<p id="shahryars-recursive-story-2">Shahryar's recursive Story</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a member of royalty named Asterion, the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges. Dunyazad suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Dunyazad told a very exciting story. &quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Dunyazad said, ending her story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Shahryar said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Shahryar decided to travel onwards. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a marble-floored peristyle, dominated by a gilt-framed mirror with a design of complex interlacing. Shahryar discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a rough triclinium, decorated with an obelisk with a design of acanthus. And that was where the encounter between a king of Persia named Shahryar and a blind poet named Homer took place. Shahryar offered advice to Homer in the form of a story.

<p>Little Nemo entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Little Nemo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Little Nemo felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a high fogou, containing a fallen column. Little Nemo muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Little Nemo chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a Baroque cyzicene hall, , within which was found a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. Little Nemo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. And there Little Nemo found the exit.</p>
