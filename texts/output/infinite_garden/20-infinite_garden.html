<p>Little Nemo wandered, lost in thought. Almost unable to believe it, Little Nemo reached the end of the labyrinth.</p>

<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Dante Alighieri said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri decided to travel onwards. Dante Alighieri walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a luxurious portico, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of arabseque. Dante Alighieri opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a marble-floored spicery, tastefully offset by a moasic framed by a pattern of complex interlacing. And that was where the encounter between a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu took place. Dante Alighieri offered advice to Murasaki Shikibu in the form of a story. So Dante Alighieri began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<p id="dante-alighieris-important-story">Dante Alighieri's important Story</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu, a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad. Jorge Luis Borges suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Jorge Luis Borges told a very convoluted story. Thus Jorge Luis Borges ended his 1st story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>
<p>So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>
<p>This is the story that Jorge Luis Borges told:</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a member of royalty named Asterion, a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu.

<p>This is the story that Little Nemo told:</p>
<p id="little-nemos-story-about-shahryar-7">Little Nemo's Story About Shahryar</p>
<p>There was once a mysterious labyrinth that some call the unknown. Shahryar couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Shahryar wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a Baroque sudatorium, dominated by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of buta motifs. Shahryar walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a luxurious kiva, dominated by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of arabseque. Shahryar opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a wide and low portico, watched over by an abat-son. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a brick-walled anatomical theatre, dominated by a pair of komaninu with a design of taijitu. Shahryar muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a primitive atelier, accented by xoanon with a design of red gems. Shahryar discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a primitive colonnade, , within which was found a quatrefoil carved into the wall. Shahryar wandered, lost in thought. Quite unexpectedly Shahryar reached the end of the labyrinth.</p>

<p>Marco Polo felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a wide and low liwan, , within which was found a trompe-l'oeil fresco. Marco Polo muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a shadowy cavaedium, accented by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of carved runes. Marco Polo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a high spicery, accented by a gilt-framed mirror with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Marco Polo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. And there Marco Polo found the exit.</p>

<p>Geoffery Chaucer decided to travel onwards. Geoffery Chaucer chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Geoffery Chaucer entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Geoffery Chaucer discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Geoffery Chaucer entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Geoffery Chaucer wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>

<p>Marco Polo decided to travel onwards. Marco Polo chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a ominous twilit solar, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of wooden carvings. Marco Polo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Marco Polo wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a marble-floored terrace, , within which was found a fountain. Marco Polo walked away from that place.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu.&quot;</p>
<p>Shahryar muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a wide and low picture gallery, , within which was found a crumbling mound of earth. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. Which was where Shahryar reached the end of the labyrinth.</p>

<p>Homer decided to travel onwards. Homer discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Homer entered a looming rotunda, containing divans lining the perimeter. Homer thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Homer entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Homer felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Homer entered a rococo library, tastefully offset by a cartouche with a mirror inside framed by a pattern of chevrons. Homer chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>

<p>Homer entered a brick-walled cryptoporticus, that had a great many columns. Homer muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Homer entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Homer thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Homer entered a primitive cavaedium, dominated by a monolith which was lined with a repeated pattern of red gems. Homer felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;That was quite useless. Perhaps there's a code.&quot;</p>
<p>Homer felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>

<p>Homer entered a primitive peristyle, decorated with a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of red gems. Homer thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. Quite unexpectedly Homer found the exit.</p>

<p>Geoffery Chaucer entered a marble hall of mirrors, , within which was found a fireplace. Geoffery Chaucer felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
