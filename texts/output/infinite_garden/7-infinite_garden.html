<p>Marco Polo entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns.

<p id="marco-polos-inspiring-story-1">Marco Polo's inspiring Story</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan, a poet of Rome named Virgil and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad. Virgil suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Virgil told a very touching story. Thus Virgil ended his 1st story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>
<p>So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>
<p>This is the story that Virgil told:</p>

<p>Geoffery Chaucer decided to travel onwards. Geoffery Chaucer chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Geoffery Chaucer entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Geoffery Chaucer walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Geoffery Chaucer entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. And that was where the encounter between an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Geoffery Chaucer offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Geoffery Chaucer began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<p id="geoffery-chaucers-inspiring-story-2">Geoffery Chaucer's inspiring Story</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan, a poet of Rome named Virgil and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad. Virgil suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Virgil told a very touching story. Thus Virgil ended his 1st story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>
<p>So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>
<p>This is the story that Virgil told:</p>
<p id="virgils-important-story-3">Virgil's important Story</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo, an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer and a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan. Geoffery Chaucer suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>
<p>This is the story that Geoffery Chaucer told:</p>
<p id="geoffery-chaucers-story-about-marco-polo-3">Geoffery Chaucer's Story About Marco Polo</p>
<p>There was once a cybertextual data structure that had never known the light of the sun. Marco Polo had followed a secret path, and so he had arrived in that place. Marco Polo felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a Churrigueresque atelier, watched over by moki steps. Marco Polo chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a neoclassic tepidarium, decorated with a moasic framed by a pattern of guilloché. Marco Polo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Marco Polo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a twilit equatorial room, dominated by a crumbling mound of earth which was lined with a repeated pattern of imbrication. Marco Polo felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a marble picture gallery, that had an abat-son. Marco Polo muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a high cavaedium, watched over by a false door. And that was where the encounter between an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo and a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri took place.

<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Geoffery Chaucer said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Geoffery Chaucer decided to travel onwards. Geoffery Chaucer walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Geoffery Chaucer entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Geoffery Chaucer thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Geoffery Chaucer entered a high tetrasoon, tastefully offset by a lararium which was lined with a repeated pattern of a dizzying spiral pattern. Geoffery Chaucer felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Geoffery Chaucer entered a twilit cryptoporticus, containing a beautiful fresco. Geoffery Chaucer chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Geoffery Chaucer entered a ominous cavaedium, accented by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Geoffery Chaucer discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>

<p>Geoffery Chaucer entered a wide and low almonry, accented by a wood-framed mirror with a design of egg-and-dart. And that was where the encounter between an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer and a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri took place. Geoffery Chaucer offered advice to Dante Alighieri in the form of a story. So Geoffery Chaucer began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a blind poet named Homer, a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges and an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo. Jorge Luis Borges suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Jorge Luis Borges told a very convoluted story. Thus Jorge Luis Borges ended his 1st story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>
<p>So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>

Little Nemo suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Little Nemo told a very touching story. &quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Little Nemo said, ending his story.</p>
