<p>There was once a mysterious labyrinth that some call the unknown. Shahryar couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. And that was where the encounter between a king of Persia named Shahryar and a blind poet named Homer took place. Shahryar offered advice to Homer in the form of a story. So Shahryar began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Shahryar told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Shahryar said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Shahryar decided to travel onwards. Shahryar wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Shahryar walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a looming library, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of scratched markings. Shahryar opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a shadowy arborium, watched over by a fire in a low basin. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a rococo colonnade, , within which was found a monolith. Shahryar muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a shadowy liwan, that had a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground. Shahryar discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>

And that was where the encounter between a king of Persia named Shahryar and a member of royalty named Asterion took place. Shahryar offered advice to Asterion in the form of a story. So Shahryar began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Shahryar told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Shahryar said, ending the story.</p>

<p>Jorge Luis Borges chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a high portico, decorated with a great many columns with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Jorge Luis Borges discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a archaic tetrasoon, tastefully offset by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of pearl inlay. Jorge Luis Borges wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a neoclassic fogou, that had moki steps. Jorge Luis Borges walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a shadowy almonry, that had a crumbling mound of earth. And that was where the encounter between a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges and a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo took place. Little Nemo offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Little Nemo began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>

<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a rough spicery, decorated with a fire in a low basin framed by a pattern of acanthus. Jorge Luis Borges chose an exit at random and walked that way. Which was where Jorge Luis Borges discovered the way out.</p>

<p>There was once a cybertextual data structure just on the other side of the garden wall. Marco Polo must have spoken the unutterable word, because he had arrived in that place. Marco Polo chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a rococo hall of doors, that had a moasic. Marco Polo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a marble-floored library, decorated with a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of complex interlacing. And that was where the encounter between an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo and an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer took place. Marco Polo offered advice to Geoffery Chaucer in the form of a story. So Marco Polo began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>

Virgil suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Virgil told a very convoluted story. &quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Virgil said, ending his story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Marco Polo said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Marco Polo decided to travel onwards. Marco Polo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror.</p>

<p>Marco Polo entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. And that was where the encounter between an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo and a king of Persia named Shahryar took place. Marco Polo offered advice to Shahryar in the form of a story. So Marco Polo began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>

<p>Virgil walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>

<p>And he told the following story:</p>

<p>There was once a twisted garden that lived in eternal twilight. Scheherazade was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Scheherazade chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a twilit kiva, containing a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. Scheherazade discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>

<p id="asterions-story-about-scheherazade-1">Asterion's Story About Scheherazade</p>
<p>There was once a twisted garden that lived in eternal twilight. Scheherazade was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Scheherazade chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Scheherazade discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a looming tetrasoon, accented by an empty cartouche which was lined with a repeated pattern of scratched markings. Scheherazade opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a primitive atelier, watched over by a fountain. Scheherazade felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. Which was where Scheherazade reached the end of the labyrinth.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Asterion said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Asterion decided to travel onwards. Asterion chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Asterion entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Asterion discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Asterion entered a high picture gallery, watched over by a glass-framed mirror. Asterion opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence. And there Asterion found the exit.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Kublai Khan said, ending his story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Virgil said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Virgil decided to travel onwards. Virgil muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Virgil thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a looming arborium, containing a quatrefoil carved into the wall. And that was where the encounter between a poet of Rome named Virgil and an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer took place. Virgil offered advice to Geoffery Chaucer in the form of a story. So Virgil began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Virgil told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Virgil said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Virgil decided to travel onwards. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence. At the darkest hour Virgil found the exit.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Dunyazad said, ending her story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Dunyazad said, ending her story.</p>

<p>Jorge Luis Borges decided to travel onwards. Jorge Luis Borges discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a primitive tablinum, that had a crumbling mound of earth. Jorge Luis Borges wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a art deco rotunda, containing a fountain. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:</p>

<p>There was once a twisted garden that lived in eternal twilight. Scheherazade was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Scheherazade chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Scheherazade discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a rococo tablinum, watched over by a cartouche with a mirror inside. Scheherazade opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a Baroque anatomical theatre, watched over by a quatrefoil carved into the wall. Scheherazade felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a wide and low still room, tastefully offset by a great many columns with a design of egg-and-dart. Scheherazade muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a rough spicery, decorated with a fire in a low basin framed by a pattern of acanthus. Scheherazade thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. At the darkest hour Scheherazade found the exit.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Virgil said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Virgil decided to travel onwards. Virgil chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a twilit tepidarium, that had a crumbling mound of earth. Virgil discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a rough picture gallery, tastefully offset by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of acanthus. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a cramped and narrow fogou, watched over by a monolith. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. Which was where Virgil reached the end of the labyrinth.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Asterion said, ending his story.</p>

<p>Asterion entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Asterion chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>

<p>Virgil walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Virgil thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>

And that was where the encounter between a poet of Rome named Virgil and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad took place. Virgil offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Virgil began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<p id="virgils-story-about-scheherazade-3">Virgil's Story About Scheherazade</p>
<p>There was once a twisted garden that lived in eternal twilight. Scheherazade was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Scheherazade chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a primitive picture gallery, decorated with a great many columns with a design of red gems. Scheherazade discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a rococo tablinum, watched over by a cartouche with a mirror inside. Scheherazade opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a luxurious portico, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of arabseque. Scheherazade felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. Which was where Scheherazade reached the end of the labyrinth.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Virgil said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Virgil decided to travel onwards. Virgil chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>

<p>Asterion entered a cramped and narrow tablinum, dominated by a wood-framed mirror with a design of three hares. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:</p>

<p>Asterion walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Asterion entered a high atelier, decorated with a koi pond which was lined with a repeated pattern of a dizzying spiral pattern. Asterion opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Asterion entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, , within which was found a pair of komaninu. Asterion thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>

<p>There was once a twisted garden that lived in eternal twilight. Scheherazade was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Scheherazade chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a high picture gallery, watched over by a glass-framed mirror. Scheherazade discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a looming tetrasoon, accented by an empty cartouche which was lined with a repeated pattern of scratched markings. Scheherazade opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>

<p>Virgil entered a brick-walled cavaedium, watched over by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. And that was where the encounter between a poet of Rome named Virgil and an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer took place. Virgil offered advice to Geoffery Chaucer in the form of a story. So Virgil began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Virgil told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Virgil said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Virgil decided to travel onwards. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a brick-walled fogou, dominated by a cartouche with a mirror inside framed by a pattern of taijitu. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>

<p>There was once a mysterious labyrinth that lived in eternal twilight. Virgil had followed a secret path, and so he had arrived in that place. Virgil chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. Virgil discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a king of Persia named Shahryar, an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo and a member of royalty named Asterion.

<p>Virgil entered a shadowy liwan, that had a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:</p>

<p>Asterion walked away from that place.</p>

<p>There was once a mysterious labyrinth that lived in eternal twilight. Asterion couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Asterion chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Asterion entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. Asterion discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Asterion entered a Churrigueresque twilit solar, watched over by an abat-son. Asterion wandered, lost in thought.</p>

<p>Asterion entered a archaic tetrasoon, tastefully offset by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of pearl inlay. Asterion wandered, lost in thought.</p>

<p>Asterion entered a twilit hall of mirrors, accented by a curved staircase framed by a pattern of imbrication. And that was where the encounter between a member of royalty named Asterion and a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan took place.

And that was where the encounter between a poet of Rome named Virgil and an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer took place. Virgil offered advice to Geoffery Chaucer in the form of a story. So Virgil began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Virgil told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Virgil said, ending the story.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;That explains a lot. Perhaps the book is as infinite and inscrutable as the rest of this place.&quot;</p>
<p>Virgil walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Virgil thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Virgil felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Virgil chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>

<p>Virgil entered a looming atrium, decorated with a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of scratched markings. And that was where the encounter between a poet of Rome named Virgil and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad took place. Virgil offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Virgil began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<p id="virgils-story-about-scheherazade-9">Virgil's Story About Scheherazade</p>
<p>There was once a twisted garden that lived in eternal twilight. Scheherazade was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Scheherazade chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a primitive picture gallery, decorated with a great many columns with a design of red gems. Scheherazade discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a twilit kiva, containing a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. Scheherazade opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Scheherazade felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Scheherazade muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a cramped and narrow hall of doors, containing a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing. Scheherazade thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Scheherazade entered a rough triclinium, decorated with an obelisk with a design of acanthus. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:</p>
