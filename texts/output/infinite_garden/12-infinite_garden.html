<p>There was once a recursive house of many doors that some call the unknown. Little Nemo couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Little Nemo wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Little Nemo muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a twilit fogou, decorated with a koi pond which was lined with a repeated pattern of imbrication. Little Nemo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a archaic almonry, , within which was found a wood-framed mirror. Little Nemo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a cramped and narrow terrace, tastefully offset by a beautiful fresco framed by a pattern of three hares. Little Nemo wandered, lost in thought.</p>

<p>Little Nemo entered a ominous 사랑방, watched over by a fallen column. Little Nemo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a marble sudatorium, dominated by an abat-son with a design of palmettes. Little Nemo wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a brick-walled cavaedium, watched over by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. Little Nemo walked away from that place.</p>

<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Murasaki Shikibu opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a luxurious cryptoporticus, containing an alcove. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu.&quot;</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Murasaki Shikibu opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a ominous picture gallery, dominated by many solomonic columns which was lined with a repeated pattern of wooden carvings. And that was where the encounter between a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a queen of Persia named Scheherazade took place. Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Scheherazade in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Murasaki Shikibu told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Murasaki Shikibu said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu decided to travel onwards. Murasaki Shikibu thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Murasaki Shikibu felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. And that was where the encounter between a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo took place. Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Little Nemo in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And she told the following story:</p>
<p id="murasaki-shikibus-story-about-little-nemo-10">Murasaki Shikibu's Story About Little Nemo</p>
<p>There was once a mysterious labyrinth from which few emerged. Little Nemo didn't know why he happened to be there. Little Nemo felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a art deco hall of mirrors, , within which was found a fallen column. Little Nemo muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a marble-floored equatorial room, decorated with a curved staircase framed by a pattern of complex interlacing. Little Nemo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a wide and low fogou, that had a parquet floor. Little Nemo felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Little Nemo chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. Little Nemo walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a marble-floored darbazi, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of complex interlacing. Little Nemo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a high portico, decorated with a great many columns with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Little Nemo felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Little Nemo entered a cramped and narrow cryptoporticus, containing a sipapu. And that was where the encounter between a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo and a king of Persia named Shahryar took place. Little Nemo offered advice to Shahryar in the form of a story. So Little Nemo began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<p id="little-nemos-story-about-shahryar-24">Little Nemo's Story About Shahryar</p>
<p>There was once a twilight dimention in space, which is the world. Shahryar was almost certain about why he happened to be there. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. And that was where the encounter between a king of Persia named Shahryar and a poet of Rome named Virgil took place. Shahryar offered advice to Virgil in the form of a story. So Shahryar began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
