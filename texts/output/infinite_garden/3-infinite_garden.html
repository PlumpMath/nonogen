<p>Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>

<p>Homer entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. And that was where the encounter between a blind poet named Homer and a philosopher named Socrates took place. Homer offered advice to Socrates in the form of a story. So Homer began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>

So Dante Alighieri began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Dante Alighieri told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Dante Alighieri said, ending the story.</p>

<p>Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>

<p>And he told the following story:</p>

<p>There was once an engmatic labyrinth that had never known the light of the sun. Kublai Khan couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Kublai Khan discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a Baroque cyzicene hall, , within which was found a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. Kublai Khan wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Kublai Khan walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a primitive atelier, watched over by a fountain. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;Perhaps it's a list of names? Or a crossword puzzle that was filled in wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Kublai Khan wandered, lost in thought. Almost unable to believe it, Kublai Khan reached the end of the labyrinth.</p>

<p>Homer decided to travel onwards. Homer felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Homer entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, decorated with a crumbling mound of earth which was lined with a repeated pattern of winding knots. Homer muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri, the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a blind poet named Homer. Dunyazad suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Dunyazad told a very exciting story. Thus Dunyazad ended her 1st story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>

<p>Shahryar entered a high tablinum, containing a cartouche with a mirror inside. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>

<p>Dante Alighieri wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a luxurious kiva, dominated by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of arabseque. Dante Alighieri muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>

<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Murasaki Shikibu said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu decided to travel onwards. Murasaki Shikibu felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>

<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a rococo picture gallery, dominated by a sipapu framed by a pattern of chevrons. And that was where the encounter between a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri took place. Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Dante Alighieri in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Murasaki Shikibu told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Murasaki Shikibu said, ending the story.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;Perhaps it's a list of names? Or a crossword puzzle that was filled in wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Marco Polo wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a wide and low atelier, accented by a glass chandelier which was lined with a repeated pattern of egg-and-dart. Marco Polo walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Marco Polo entered a marble-floored spicery, accented by an empty cartouche which was lined with a repeated pattern of complex interlacing. And that was where the encounter between an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu took place. Marco Polo offered advice to Murasaki Shikibu in the form of a story. So Marco Polo began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<h4 id="marco-polos-recursive-story">Marco Polo's recursive Story</h4>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri, the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a blind poet named Homer. Dunyazad suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Dunyazad told a very exciting story. Thus Dunyazad ended her 1st story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>
<p>So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>
<p>This is the story that Dunyazad told:</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a king of Persia named Shahryar, a philosopher named Socrates and an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer. Socrates suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>
<p>This is the story that Socrates told:</p>

<p>There was once a twilight dimention in space, which is the world. Shahryar couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a looming lumber room, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of scratched markings. Shahryar muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a high tablinum, containing a cartouche with a mirror inside. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:</p>

<p>This is the story that Jorge Luis Borges told:</p>
<h5 id="jorge-luis-borgess-story-about-kublai-khan-4">Jorge Luis Borges's Story About Kublai Khan</h5>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;Maybe it's a clue to where the exit is. Perhaps there's a code.&quot;</p>
<p>Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a primitive anatomical theatre, accented by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of red gems. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Shahryar entered a marble twilit solar, , within which was found an abat-son. And that was where the encounter between a king of Persia named Shahryar and a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo took place. Shahryar offered advice to Little Nemo in the form of a story. So Shahryar began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>

<p>There was once a recursive house of many doors, which is the world. Murasaki Shikibu was almost certain about why she happened to be there. Murasaki Shikibu felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a high picture gallery, watched over by a glass-framed mirror. Murasaki Shikibu muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a rococo colonnade, , within which was found a monolith. Murasaki Shikibu thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>

<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Murasaki Shikibu chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a Churrigueresque spicery, dominated by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Murasaki Shikibu discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a marble-floored spicery, tastefully offset by a moasic framed by a pattern of complex interlacing. Murasaki Shikibu opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>

<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. And that was where the encounter between a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a king of Persia named Shahryar took place. Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Shahryar in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>

<p>Dante Alighieri entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. And that was where the encounter between a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Dante Alighieri offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Dante Alighieri began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Dante Alighieri told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Dante Alighieri said, ending the story.</p>

<p>Marco Polo decided to travel onwards. Marco Polo wandered, lost in thought.</p>

<p>Kublai Khan wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Kublai Khan walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. And that was where the encounter between a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu took place. Kublai Khan offered advice to Murasaki Shikibu in the form of a story. So Kublai Khan began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>

Thus Dunyazad ended her 1st story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>
<p>So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>
<p>This is the story that Dunyazad told:</p>

<p>Dante Alighieri opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu. Perhaps there's a code.&quot;</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a neoclassic peristyle, containing a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a high spicery, accented by a gilt-framed mirror with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Dante Alighieri muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Dante Alighieri thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>

<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Kublai Khan said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan decided to travel onwards. Kublai Khan felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. At the darkest hour Kublai Khan reached the end of the labyrinth.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a member of royalty named Asterion, a poet of Rome named Virgil and a philosopher named Socrates. Virgil suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Virgil told a very symbolic story. Thus Virgil ended his 1st story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>

<p>Dante Alighieri wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, , within which was found a pair of komaninu. Dante Alighieri muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings.

<p>Murasaki Shikibu decided to travel onwards. Murasaki Shikibu felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a looming rotunda, containing divans lining the perimeter. Murasaki Shikibu muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a primitive peristyle, decorated with a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of red gems. And that was where the encounter between a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri took place. Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Dante Alighieri in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Murasaki Shikibu told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Murasaki Shikibu said, ending the story.</p>

Virgil offered advice to Socrates in the form of a story. So Virgil began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<h5 id="virgils-story-about-dante-alighieri-29">Virgil's Story About Dante Alighieri</h5>
<p>There was once an architectural forest, which is the world. Dante Alighieri didn't know why he happened to be there. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a looming arborium, watched over by a pair of komaninu. Dante Alighieri muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a twilit cryptoporticus, containing a beautiful fresco. And that was where the encounter between a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Dante Alighieri offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Dante Alighieri began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Dante Alighieri told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Dante Alighieri said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri decided to travel onwards. Dante Alighieri felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a twilit cryptoporticus, containing a beautiful fresco. Dante Alighieri chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a primitive peristyle, decorated with a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of red gems. Dante Alighieri discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. At the darkest hour Dante Alighieri found the exit.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Virgil said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Virgil decided to travel onwards. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Virgil muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a neoclassic liwan, tastefully offset by moki steps which was lined with a repeated pattern of guilloché.

<p>Virgil entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a rococo tablinum, watched over by a cartouche with a mirror inside. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Virgil muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>

<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a primitive triclinium, tastefully offset by many solomonic columns which was lined with a repeated pattern of red gems. Murasaki Shikibu walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a rough spicery, decorated with a fire in a low basin framed by a pattern of acanthus. Murasaki Shikibu opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a moasic framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Murasaki Shikibu felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Murasaki Shikibu muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a marble-floored darbazi, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of complex interlacing. Murasaki Shikibu chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>

<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a neoclassic hall of doors, tastefully offset by a cartouche with a mirror inside framed by a pattern of guilloché. And that was where the encounter between a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a philosopher named Socrates took place. Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Socrates in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And she told the following story:</p>
<h5 id="murasaki-shikibus-story-about-dante-alighieri-13">Murasaki Shikibu's Story About Dante Alighieri</h5>
<p>There was once an architectural forest, which is the world. Dante Alighieri didn't know why he happened to be there. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. And that was where the encounter between a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Dante Alighieri offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Dante Alighieri began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Dante Alighieri told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Dante Alighieri said, ending the story.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu. Perhaps there's a code.&quot;</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a rococo liwan, watched over by a fountain. Murasaki Shikibu felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a looming library, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of scratched markings. Murasaki Shikibu muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a primitive colonnade, , within which was found a quatrefoil carved into the wall. Murasaki Shikibu thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Murasaki Shikibu felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a primitive atelier, watched over by a fountain. Murasaki Shikibu chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. Almost unable to believe it, Murasaki Shikibu discovered the way out.</p>

<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a marble-floored library, tastefully offset by an exedra which was lined with a repeated pattern of complex interlacing. Murasaki Shikibu opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Murasaki Shikibu entered a high kiva, accented by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of a dizzying spiral pattern. Murasaki Shikibu felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>

And that was where the encounter between a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a king of Persia named Shahryar took place. Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Shahryar in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And she told the following story:</p>
<h4 id="murasaki-shikibus-story-about-virgil-20">Murasaki Shikibu's Story About Virgil</h4>
<p>There was once a twilight dimention in space from which few emerged. Virgil didn't know why he happened to be there. Virgil wandered, lost in thought.</p>

<p>Virgil entered a high portico, decorated with a great many columns with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Virgil wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Virgil entered a rough triclinium, decorated with an obelisk with a design of acanthus.

So Virgil began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>

<p>Dante Alighieri decided to travel onwards. Dante Alighieri felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;It is as confusing as this maze.&quot;</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>

<p>Dante Alighieri entered a primitive atelier, watched over by a fountain. Dante Alighieri muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. Quite unexpectedly Dante Alighieri reached the end of the labyrinth.</p>
