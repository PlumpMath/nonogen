"So you see how that story was very like this place," Dunyazad said, ending the story. 

Dunyazad decided to travel onwards. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Dunyazad entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Dunyazad walked away from that place. 

Dunyazad entered a rough spicery, decorated with a fire in a low basin framed by a pattern of acanthus. Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Dunyazad entered a Baroque still room, tastefully offset by a false door framed by a pattern of buta motifs. Dunyazad thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Dunyazad entered a archaic triclinium, tastefully offset by a fire in a low basin framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Dunyazad entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Dunyazad entered a brick-walled picture gallery, watched over by a parquet floor. And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a member of royalty named Asterion took place. Asterion offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Asterion began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

#########Asterion's Story About Jorge Luis Borges

"Well," she said, "I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu."

Dunyazad walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dunyazad entered a primitive colonnade, , within which was found a quatrefoil carved into the wall. Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. Quite unexpectedly Dunyazad found the exit.

There was once a library just on the other side of the garden wall. Geoffery Chaucer was lost, like so many before and after, and he had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Geoffery Chaucer muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened.
