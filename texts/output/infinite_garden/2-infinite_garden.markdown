"Well," he said, "Perhaps it's a list of names? Or a crossword puzzle that was filled in wrong."

Jorge Luis Borges wandered, lost in thought. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a cramped and narrow hall of doors, containing a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing. Jorge Luis Borges walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Jorge Luis Borges entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. And that was where the encounter between a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu took place. Jorge Luis Borges offered advice to Murasaki Shikibu in the form of a story. So Jorge Luis Borges began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

#######Jorge Luis Borges's recursive Story

Once upon a time, there was a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri, the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a blind poet named Homer. Dunyazad suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Dunyazad told a very exciting story. Thus Dunyazad ended her 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Dunyazad told:


########Dunyazad's important Story

Once upon a time, there was a king of Persia named Shahryar, a philosopher named Socrates and an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer. Socrates suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Socrates told:

#########Socrates's Story About Shahryar

There was once a twilight dimention in space, which is the world. Shahryar couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Shahryar entered a Churrigueresque hall of mirrors, accented by many solomonic columns which was lined with a repeated pattern of winding knots. Shahryar muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Shahryar entered a brick-walled almonry, tastefully offset by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of taijitu. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Shahryar entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Shahryar entered a shadowy picture gallery, accented by moki steps which was lined with a repeated pattern of carved runes. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "Maybe it's a clue to where the exit is. Perhaps there's a code."

Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Shahryar entered a brick-walled cavaedium, watched over by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Shahryar entered a marble twilit solar, , within which was found an abat-son. And that was where the encounter between a king of Persia named Shahryar and a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo took place. Shahryar offered advice to Little Nemo in the form of a story. So Shahryar began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

##########Shahryar's Story About Murasaki Shikibu

There was once a recursive house of many doors, which is the world. Murasaki Shikibu was almost certain about why she happened to be there. Murasaki Shikibu felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.

Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Shahryar in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And she told the following story:

Dunyazad suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Dunyazad told a very exciting story. Thus Dunyazad ended her 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

###########Socrates's Story About Shahryar

There was once a twilight dimention in space, which is the world. Shahryar couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.

Shahryar entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out.

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a high triclinium, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Dante Alighieri thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Dante Alighieri entered a high spicery, accented by a gilt-framed mirror with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Dante Alighieri felt sure that this must be the way out.

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Virgil said, ending the story. 

Virgil decided to travel onwards. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. At the darkest hour Virgil reached the end of the labyrinth.

And he told the following story:

######Jorge Luis Borges's recursive Story

Once upon a time, there was a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri, the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a blind poet named Homer. Dunyazad suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Dunyazad told a very exciting story. Thus Dunyazad ended her 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Dunyazad told:

Murasaki Shikibu entered a marble-floored spicery, tastefully offset by a moasic framed by a pattern of complex interlacing. Murasaki Shikibu muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. Murasaki Shikibu thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.

"Well," he said, "That explains a lot."

Kublai Khan wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Kublai Khan entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Kublai Khan walked away from that place. 

Kublai Khan entered a wide and low portico, watched over by an abat-son. Kublai Khan opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Kublai Khan entered a cramped and narrow fogou, watched over by a monolith. Kublai Khan felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Kublai Khan entered a luxurious portico, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of arabseque. And that was where the encounter between a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo took place. Kublai Khan offered advice to Marco Polo in the form of a story. So Kublai Khan began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Kublai Khan told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Kublai Khan said, ending the story. 

Kublai Khan decided to travel onwards. Kublai Khan felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Kublai Khan entered a luxurious colonnade, watched over by a gargoyle. Kublai Khan chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Kublai Khan entered a luxurious cryptoporticus, containing an alcove. And that was where the encounter between a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad took place. Kublai Khan offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Kublai Khan began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

######Kublai Khan's Story About Dunyazad

There was once an engmatic labyrinth just on the other side of the garden wall. Dunyazad wasn't quite sure where this was, only that she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a archaic atelier, , within which was found a monolith. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Dunyazad entered a marble-floored library, decorated with a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of complex interlacing. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Dunyazad entered a rococo triclinium, , within which was found a pair of komaninu. Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a high spicery, containing a quatrefoil carved into the wall. Dunyazad walked away from that place. 

Dunyazad entered a primitive peristyle, decorated with a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of red gems. Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. At the darkest hour Dunyazad found the exit.

##############Socrates's Story About Shahryar

There was once a twilight dimention in space, which is the world. Shahryar couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Shahryar entered a marble twilit solar, , within which was found an abat-son. Shahryar muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Shahryar entered a shadowy still room, that had a koi pond. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Shahryar entered a rough library, that had xoanon. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Shahryar entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a Churrigueresque atrium, containing a moasic. Dante Alighieri thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.

Virgil decided to travel onwards. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Virgil entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Virgil muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Virgil entered a Baroque tablinum, dominated by a curved staircase framed by a pattern of buta motifs. And that was where the encounter between a poet of Rome named Virgil and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Virgil offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Virgil began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Virgil told a very exciting story.

Dante Alighieri entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. And that was where the encounter between a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Dante Alighieri offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Dante Alighieri began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Dante Alighieri told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Dante Alighieri said, ending the story. 

Dante Alighieri decided to travel onwards. Dante Alighieri felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a twilit cryptoporticus, containing a beautiful fresco. Dante Alighieri discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Dante Alighieri entered a brick-walled almonry, tastefully offset by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of taijitu. Dante Alighieri opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Dante Alighieri entered a brick-walled cryptoporticus, that had a glass-framed mirror. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.

"Well," he said, "I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu. Perhaps there's a code."

Dante Alighieri wandered, lost in thought. 

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings.

"Well," he said, "Perhaps it's a list of names? Or a crossword puzzle that was filled in wrong."

Homer wandered, lost in thought. 

Homer entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Homer walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Homer entered a neoclassic tepidarium, that had an obelisk. And that was where the encounter between a blind poet named Homer and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu took place. Homer offered advice to Murasaki Shikibu in the form of a story. So Homer began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

##########Homer's recursive Story

Once upon a time, there was a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri, the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a blind poet named Homer. Dunyazad suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Dunyazad told a very exciting story. Thus Dunyazad ended her 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Dunyazad told:


###########Dunyazad's important Story

Once upon a time, there was a king of Persia named Shahryar, a philosopher named Socrates and an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer. Socrates suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Socrates told:

############Socrates's Story About Shahryar

There was once a twilight dimention in space, which is the world. Shahryar couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Shahryar entered a marble twilit solar, , within which was found an abat-son. Shahryar muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Shahryar entered a looming atelier, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of scratched markings. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Shahryar entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Shahryar entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..."

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Dante Alighieri said, ending the story. 

Dante Alighieri decided to travel onwards. Dante Alighieri walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a brick-walled hall of mirrors, decorated with a sipapu framed by a pattern of taijitu. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. And that was where the encounter between a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a philosopher named Socrates took place. Dante Alighieri offered advice to Socrates in the form of a story. So Dante Alighieri began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

###############Dante Alighieri's inspiring Story

Once upon a time, there was a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu, a member of royalty named Asterion and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges. Asterion suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Asterion told a very touching story. Thus Asterion ended his 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Asterion told:


################Asterion's important Story

Once upon a time, there was a member of royalty named Asterion, a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges and a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo. Jorge Luis Borges suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Jorge Luis Borges told:

#################Jorge Luis Borges's Story About Asterion

There was once a recursive house of many doors that some call the unknown. Asterion couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Asterion wandered, lost in thought. Quite unexpectedly Asterion reached the end of the labyrinth. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Jorge Luis Borges said, ending his story.

"And that was how it happened," Asterion said, ending his story.

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Dante Alighieri said, ending the story. 

Dante Alighieri decided to travel onwards. Dante Alighieri walked away from that place. 

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Dante Alighieri entered a high kiva, accented by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of a dizzying spiral pattern. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. Which was where Dante Alighieri discovered the way out.

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Virgil said, ending the story. 

Virgil decided to travel onwards. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Virgil entered a rough triclinium, decorated with an obelisk with a design of acanthus. Virgil muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Virgil entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. And that was where the encounter between a poet of Rome named Virgil and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Virgil offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Virgil began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Virgil told a very exciting story.

Virgil entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Virgil chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Virgil entered a archaic atrium, accented by a fire in a low basin framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. Virgil discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Virgil entered a art deco kiva, dominated by a glass chandelier which was lined with a repeated pattern of blue stones. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Virgil entered a brick-walled hall of doors, decorated with a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of taijitu. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Virgil entered a wide and low cavaedium, watched over by a curved staircase. Virgil muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps.

#########Homer's recursive Story

Once upon a time, there was a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri, the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a blind poet named Homer.

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Dunyazad told:

"Well," he said, "It is as confusing as this maze."

Dante Alighieri opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Dante Alighieri entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dante Alighieri entered a brick-walled almonry, tastefully offset by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of taijitu. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a marble picture gallery, that had an abat-son. Dante Alighieri chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a cramped and narrow colonnade, dominated by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of three hares. Dante Alighieri discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.

"Well," he said, "I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu. Perhaps there's a code."

Dante Alighieri wandered, lost in thought. 

Dante Alighieri entered a marble-floored triclinium, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of complex interlacing. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.

Murasaki Shikibu decided to travel onwards. Murasaki Shikibu felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a rough triclinium, decorated with an obelisk with a design of acanthus. Murasaki Shikibu muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a rough triclinium, decorated with an obelisk with a design of acanthus. And that was where the encounter between a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri took place.

"Well," he said, "It is as confusing as this maze."

Dante Alighieri opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Dante Alighieri entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Dante Alighieri felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dante Alighieri entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Dante Alighieri muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Dante Alighieri chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Dante Alighieri entered a cramped and narrow fogou, watched over by a monolith. Dante Alighieri discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. Almost unable to believe it, Dante Alighieri found the exit.

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Virgil said, ending the story. 

Virgil decided to travel onwards. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Virgil entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, , within which was found a pair of komaninu. Virgil muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Virgil entered a luxurious portico, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of arabseque. And that was where the encounter between a poet of Rome named Virgil and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Virgil offered advice to Jorge Luis Borges in the form of a story. So Virgil began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Virgil told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Virgil said, ending the story. 

Virgil decided to travel onwards. Virgil felt sure that this must be the way out.
