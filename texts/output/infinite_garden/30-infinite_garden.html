<p>There was once a vast and perilous maze just on the other side of the garden wall. Kublai Khan couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Kublai Khan muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a wide and low almonry, dominated by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. Kublai Khan thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a primitive cyzicene hall, that had a semi-dome. Kublai Khan felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a cramped and narrow still room, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of three hares. Kublai Khan chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Kublai Khan entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. Kublai Khan walked away from that place.</p>

<p>Kublai Khan entered a archaic equatorial room, accented by an abat-son with a design of pearl inlay. And that was where the encounter between a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and a queen of Persia named Scheherazade took place. Kublai Khan offered advice to Scheherazade in the form of a story. So Kublai Khan began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>

<p>Jorge Luis Borges entered a Baroque cyzicene hall, , within which was found a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. And that was where the encounter between a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges and an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer took place.

<p>Homer entered a art deco hall of doors, tastefully offset by an empty cartouche which was lined with a repeated pattern of blue stones. Homer discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror.</p>

<p>Homer entered a archaic fogou, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil carved into the wall with a design of pearl inlay. Homer thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror.</p>
<p>Homer entered a Baroque peristyle, dominated by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Homer felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>

So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Dante Alighieri told a very touching story. &quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Dante Alighieri said, ending his story.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Jorge Luis Borges said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Socrates decided to travel onwards. Socrates discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Socrates wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a high spicery, accented by a gilt-framed mirror with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Socrates walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a looming hedge maze, , within which was found a beautiful fresco. And that was where the encounter between a philosopher named Socrates and an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer took place. Socrates offered advice to Geoffery Chaucer in the form of a story. So Socrates began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<p id="socratess-story-about-homer">Socrates's Story About Homer</p>
<p>There was once an expansive zone that was a map of itself. Homer must have gotten lost, because he was wandering there. Homer chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.</p>
<p>Homer entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Homer discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror.</p>

<p>Homer entered a wide and low portico, watched over by an abat-son. Homer thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror.</p>
<p>Homer entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Homer felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>

<p>Thus Scheherazade ended her 947th story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>
<p>So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Scheherazade told a very intertwined story. Thus Scheherazade ended her 948th story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>
<p>So she began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Scheherazade told a very thrilling story. Thus Scheherazade ended her 949th story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges, a member of royalty named Asterion and a philosopher named Socrates. Asterion suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Asterion told a very exciting story. Thus Asterion ended his 1st story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>
<p>So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>
<p>This is the story that Asterion told:</p>
<h3 id="asterions-story-about-socrates">Asterion's Story About Socrates</h3>
<p>There was once an engmatic labyrinth just on the other side of the garden wall. Socrates was lost, like so many before and after, and he had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Socrates chose an exit at random and walked that way.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a high kiva, accented by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of a dizzying spiral pattern. Socrates discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Socrates opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Socrates felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Socrates muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:</p>

<p>Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a brick-walled almonry, tastefully offset by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of taijitu. Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror.</p>
<p>Dunyazad entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Dunyazad walked away from that place.</p>

<p>Dunyazad entered a luxurious portico, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of arabseque. And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a king of Persia named Shahryar took place. Dunyazad offered advice to Shahryar in the form of a story. So Dunyazad began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Dunyazad told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Dunyazad said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Dunyazad decided to travel onwards. Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. Almost unable to believe it, Dunyazad reached the end of the labyrinth.</p>

<p>Homer entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Homer discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror.</p>
<p>Homer entered a rough library, that had xoanon. Homer wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Homer entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Homer walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.</p>

So Scheherazade began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Scheherazade told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Scheherazade said, ending the story.</p>

<hr />
<p>Thus Socrates ended his 2nd story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>
<p>So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Socrates told a very convoluted story. &quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Socrates said, ending his story.</p>

And that was where the encounter between a blind poet named Homer and an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo took place. Homer offered advice to Marco Polo in the form of a story. So Homer began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges, a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan and a philosopher named Socrates. Kublai Khan suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Kublai Khan told a very exciting story. Thus Kublai Khan ended his 1st story, saying, &quot;But there is another tale which is more marvelous still.&quot;</p>
<p>So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot;</p>
<p>This is the story that Kublai Khan told:</p>

<h4 id="geoffery-chaucers-story-about-socrates-9">Geoffery Chaucer's Story About Socrates</h4>
<p>There was once a vast and perilous maze, the place that can sometimes be glimpsed through mirrors. Socrates couldn't quite say how he was wandering there. Socrates felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Socrates entered a art deco hall of doors, tastefully offset by an empty cartouche which was lined with a repeated pattern of blue stones. Socrates chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.</p>

And that was where the encounter between a philosopher named Socrates and a blind librarian named Jorge Luis Borges took place. Jorge Luis Borges offered advice to Socrates in the form of a story. So Jorge Luis Borges began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot;</p>
<p>And he told the following story:</p>
<h5 id="jorge-luis-borgess-inspiring-story-40">Jorge Luis Borges's inspiring Story</h5>
<p>Once upon a time, there was the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad, a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a philosopher named Socrates. Dante Alighieri suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, &quot;It is related, O august king, that...&quot; And Dante Alighieri told a very touching story. &quot;And that was how it happened,&quot; Dante Alighieri said, ending his story.</p>

<p>Homer entered a wide and low antechamber, tastefully offset by a stone-framed mirror which was lined with a repeated pattern of egg-and-dart. Homer discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, passing a reflection in a mirror.</p>
<p>Homer entered a brick-walled almonry, tastefully offset by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of taijitu. Homer wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Homer entered a cramped and narrow colonnade, dominated by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of three hares. Homer walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.</p>
<p>Homer entered a marble-floored cyzicene hall, , within which was found a sipapu. Homer muttered, &quot;North, this way is probably north!&quot; as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.</p>
<p>Homer entered a wide and low liwan, , within which was found a trompe-l'oeil fresco. Homer thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, passing a reflection in a mirror.</p>
<p>Homer entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Homer felt sure that this must be the way out.</p>
<p>Homer entered a Baroque tablinum, dominated by a curved staircase framed by a pattern of buta motifs. Homer chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.</p>
<p>Homer entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. And that was where the encounter between a blind poet named Homer and a queen of Persia named Scheherazade took place. Scheherazade offered advice to Homer in the form of a story. So Scheherazade began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Scheherazade told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Scheherazade said, ending the story.</p>
<p>Homer decided to travel onwards. Homer wandered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Homer entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Homer felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad, a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a philosopher named Socrates.

<p>Socrates entered a marble-floored cyzicene hall, , within which was found a sipapu. And that was where the encounter between a philosopher named Socrates and a queen of Persia named Scheherazade took place. Scheherazade offered advice to Socrates in the form of a story. So Scheherazade began, &quot;It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when...&quot; And Scheherazade told a very exciting story. &quot;So you see how that story was very like this place,&quot; Scheherazade said, ending the story.</p>
