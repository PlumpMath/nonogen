# Ten Stories by Scheherazade 

Once upon a time, there was a king of Persia named Shahryar, a sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a queen of Persia named Scheherazade. Scheherazade suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

## 1: Scheherazade's Story About Shahryar

There was once an engmatic labyrinth that was a map of itself. Shahryar wasn't quite sure where this was, only that he had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Shahryar wandered, lost in thought. 

Shahryar entered a looming atelier, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of scratched markings. And that was where the encounter between a king of Persia named Shahryar and a member of royalty named Asterion took place. Asterion offered advice to Shahryar in the form of a story. So Asterion began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

## 2: Asterion's moving story

Once upon a time, there was a poet of Rome named Virgil, an explorer of Venice named Marco Polo and a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan. Virgil suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Virgil told:

## 3: Virgil's Story About Virgil

There was once an engmatic labyrinth that was a map of itself. Virgil wasn't quite sure where this was, only that he had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Virgil walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Virgil entered a marble-floored fogou, dominated by a glass-framed mirror framed by a pattern of complex interlacing. Virgil felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Virgil entered a neoclassic liwan, tastefully offset by moki steps which was lined with a repeated pattern of guilloché. Virgil muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Virgil entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. Virgil chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Virgil entered a wide and low fogou, watched over by a koi pond. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Virgil entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Virgil walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Virgil entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. Virgil felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Virgil entered a rococo hall of doors, that had a fireplace. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Virgil entered a archaic still room, accented by a curved staircase framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. Virgil wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Virgil entered a archaic still room, accented by a curved staircase framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "That was quite useless."

Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Virgil entered a high triclinium, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Virgil felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. And there Virgil discovered the way out. 

---

Thus Virgil ended his 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Virgil told:


## 3: Virgil's convoluted story

Once upon a time, there was a poet of Rome named Virgil, a blind poet named Homer and a young English girl named Alice. Virgil suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Virgil told:


## 4: Virgil's thrilling story

Once upon a time, there was a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan, a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a poet of Rome named Virgil. Virgil suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Virgil told:

## 5: Virgil's Story About Alice

There was once a cybertextual data structure that had never known the light of the sun. Alice was almost certain about why she happened to be there. Alice wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Alice entered a archaic rotunda, watched over by a curved staircase. Alice thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Alice entered a wide and low fogou, watched over by a koi pond. Alice muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Alice entered a Churrigueresque atelier, watched over by moki steps. Alice opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Alice entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Alice chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Alice entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Alice thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Alice entered a archaic rotunda, watched over by a curved staircase. Alice discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Alice entered a rococo tepidarium, dominated by a beautiful fresco framed by a pattern of chevrons. Alice muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Alice entered a neoclassic tepidarium, that had an obelisk. Alice opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Alice entered a twilit equatorial room, dominated by a crumbling mound of earth which was lined with a repeated pattern of imbrication. Alice chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Alice entered a Churrigueresque spicery, dominated by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Alice felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Alice entered a Churrigueresque spicery, dominated by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Alice walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Alice entered a ominous sudatorium, tastefully offset by a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

"Well," she said, "It is as confusing as this maze."

Alice felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Alice entered a primitive peristyle, decorated with a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of red gems. Alice muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. At the darkest hour Alice found the exit.

Thus Virgil ended his 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Virgil told:


## 5: Virgil's important story

Once upon a time, there was a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan, a poet of Rome named Virgil and a member of royalty named Asterion. Asterion suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Asterion told a very complex story. "And that was how it happened," Asterion said, ending his story.

Thus Virgil ended his 2nd story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Virgil told:

## 5: Virgil's Story About Dunyazad

There was once a vast and perilous maze that had never known the light of the sun. Dunyazad was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Dunyazad entered a looming atelier, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of scratched markings. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a rococo tepidarium, dominated by a beautiful fresco framed by a pattern of chevrons. Dunyazad walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a wide and low fogou, watched over by a koi pond. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

"Well," she said, "It is as confusing as this maze."

Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a brick-walled still room, tastefully offset by moki steps which was lined with a repeated pattern of taijitu. Dunyazad muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a cramped and narrow peristyle, watched over by a stone-framed mirror. Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a primitive picture gallery, decorated with a great many columns with a design of red gems. And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu took place. Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And she told the following story:

## 6: Murasaki Shikibu's Story About Shahryar

There was once a twisted garden that lived in eternal twilight. Shahryar didn't know why he happened to be there. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Shahryar entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence.

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Murasaki Shikibu said, ending the story. 

Dunyazad decided to travel onwards. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a cramped and narrow fogou, watched over by a monolith. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence. Quite unexpectedly Dunyazad reached the end of the labyrinth.

This is the story that Virgil told:


## 3: Virgil's thrilling story

Once upon a time, there was a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan, a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a poet of Rome named Virgil. Virgil suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..."

## 4: Virgil's Story About Dunyazad

There was once a vast and perilous maze that had never known the light of the sun. Dunyazad was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Dunyazad entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Dunyazad walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.

Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.

And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu took place. Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And she told the following story:

## 5: Murasaki Shikibu's Story About Shahryar

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

## 1: Scheherazade's Story About Virgil

There was once a twisted garden, which is the world. Virgil wasn't quite sure where this was, only that he had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Virgil thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Virgil entered a wide and low cavaedium, watched over by a curved staircase. Virgil walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 2nd story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:


## 1: Scheherazade's intertwined story

Once upon a time, there was a member of royalty named Asterion, a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo and a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan. Little Nemo suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Little Nemo told:


## 2: Little Nemo's convoluted story

Once upon a time, there was a poet of Rome named Virgil, a blind poet named Homer and a young English girl named Alice. Virgil suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..."

Alice felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. Almost unable to believe it, Alice found the exit.

There was once a vast and perilous maze that had never known the light of the sun. Dunyazad was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Dunyazad entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.

"Well," she said, "It is as confusing as this maze."

Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a brick-walled still room, tastefully offset by moki steps which was lined with a repeated pattern of taijitu. Dunyazad muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a neoclassic hedge maze, dominated by a fallen column with a design of guilloché. And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu took place. Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And she told the following story:

## 5: Murasaki Shikibu's Story About Shahryar

There was once a twisted garden that lived in eternal twilight. Shahryar didn't know why he happened to be there. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Shahryar entered a marble-floored library, decorated with a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of complex interlacing. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Shahryar entered a marble picture gallery, watched over by a stone-framed mirror. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Shahryar entered a looming anatomical theatre, dominated by a glass-framed mirror framed by a pattern of scratched markings. Shahryar muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Shahryar entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Shahryar opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Shahryar entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Shahryar entered a rococo triclinium, within which was found a pair of komaninu. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Shahryar entered a looming library, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of scratched markings. Shahryar discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Shahryar entered a primitive peristyle, decorated with a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of red gems. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out. At the darkest hour Shahryar found the exit. 

---

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Murasaki Shikibu said, ending the story. 

Dunyazad decided to travel onwards. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a twilit tepidarium, tastefully offset by moki steps which was lined with a repeated pattern of imbrication. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Dunyazad entered a twilit almonry, dominated by an empty cartouche which was lined with a repeated pattern of imbrication. Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out. Almost unable to believe it, Dunyazad discovered the way out.

"And that was how it happened," Virgil said, ending his story.

Thus Little Nemo ended his 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Little Nemo told:


## 2: Little Nemo's thrilling story

Once upon a time, there was a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan, a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri and a poet of Rome named Virgil. Virgil suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Virgil told:

## 3: Virgil's Story About Alice

There was once a cybertextual data structure that had never known the light of the sun. Alice was almost certain about why she happened to be there. Alice wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Alice entered a archaic arborium, accented by many solomonic columns which was lined with a repeated pattern of pearl inlay. Alice thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Alice entered a luxurious hall of doors, dominated by a stone-framed mirror which was lined with a repeated pattern of arabseque. Alice muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Alice entered a neoclassic liwan, tastefully offset by moki steps which was lined with a repeated pattern of guilloché. Alice opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Alice entered a marble picture gallery, that had an abat-son. Alice chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Alice entered a wide and low lumber room, that had a great many columns. Alice thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Alice entered a archaic rotunda, watched over by a curved staircase. Alice discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Alice entered a looming atelier, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of scratched markings. Alice muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Alice entered a rough equatorial room, tastefully offset by a gilt-framed mirror with a design of acanthus. Alice opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Alice entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Alice chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Alice entered a twilit kiva, tastefully offset by a fallen column with a design of imbrication. Alice felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Alice entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Alice walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way.

"Well," she said, "It is as confusing as this maze."

Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a high hall of doors, that had a beautiful fresco. Dunyazad muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu took place. Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And she told the following story:

## 4: Murasaki Shikibu's Story About Shahryar

There was once a twisted garden that lived in eternal twilight. Shahryar didn't know why he happened to be there. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Shahryar entered a luxurious cryptoporticus, containing an alcove. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Shahryar entered a luxurious cryptoporticus, containing an alcove. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Shahryar entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Shahryar muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Shahryar entered a ominous picture gallery, dominated by many solomonic columns which was lined with a repeated pattern of wooden carvings. Shahryar opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Shahryar entered a cramped and narrow hall of doors, containing a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Shahryar entered a archaic still room, accented by a curved staircase framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Shahryar entered a wide and low portico, watched over by an abat-son. Shahryar discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Shahryar entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out. At the darkest hour Shahryar found the exit. 

---

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Murasaki Shikibu said, ending the story. 

Dunyazad decided to travel onwards. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a looming atrium, decorated with a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of scratched markings. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Dunyazad entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out. Almost unable to believe it, Dunyazad discovered the way out. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Virgil said, ending his story. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Little Nemo said, ending his story. 

---

Thus Scheherazade ended her 3rd story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:


## 1: Scheherazade's intertwined story

Once upon a time, there was the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad, a king of Persia named Shahryar and a member of royalty named Asterion. Dunyazad suggested that she should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Dunyazad told:

## 2: Dunyazad's Story About Murasaki Shikibu

There was once an expansive zone just on the other side of the garden wall. Murasaki Shikibu didn't know why she happened to be there. Murasaki Shikibu muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a luxurious library, watched over by a gilt-framed mirror. Murasaki Shikibu opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Murasaki Shikibu felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a primitive peristyle, decorated with a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of red gems. Murasaki Shikibu walked away from that place. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a high fogou, containing a fallen column. And that was where the encounter between a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a king of Persia named Shahryar took place. Shahryar offered advice to Murasaki Shikibu in the form of a story. So Shahryar began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Shahryar told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Shahryar said, ending the story. 

Murasaki Shikibu decided to travel onwards. Murasaki Shikibu opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a primitive atelier, watched over by a fountain. Murasaki Shikibu chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Murasaki Shikibu thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a looming hedge maze, tastefully offset by a glass-framed mirror framed by a pattern of scratched markings. Murasaki Shikibu discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a looming hedge maze, tastefully offset by a glass-framed mirror framed by a pattern of scratched markings. Murasaki Shikibu muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a ominous picture gallery, dominated by many solomonic columns which was lined with a repeated pattern of wooden carvings. Murasaki Shikibu opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a luxurious library, watched over by a gilt-framed mirror. Murasaki Shikibu chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Murasaki Shikibu felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Murasaki Shikibu walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

Thus Dunyazad ended her 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Dunyazad told:

## 2: Dunyazad's Story About Alice

There was once a cybertextual data structure that had never known the light of the sun. Alice was almost certain about why she happened to be there. Alice wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Alice entered a high hall of doors, within which was found an abat-son. Alice thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Alice entered a shadowy atelier, within which was found a fountain. Alice muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Alice entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. Alice opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Alice entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Alice chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Alice entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Alice thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.

Alice entered a marble darbazi, within which was found a fireplace. Alice walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Alice entered a marble antechamber, decorated with a glass chandelier which was lined with a repeated pattern of palmettes. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

"Well," she said, "It is as confusing as this maze."

Alice felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Alice entered a rococo cavaedium, dominated by a gilt-framed mirror with a design of chevrons. Alice muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Alice entered a Baroque cyzicene hall, within which was found a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. Alice opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. Which was where Alice discovered the way out.

Thus Dunyazad ended her 2nd story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Dunyazad told:


## 2: Dunyazad's important story

Once upon a time, there was a Khagan of the Ikh Mongol Uls named Kublai Khan, a poet of Rome named Virgil and a member of royalty named Asterion. Asterion suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Asterion told a very complex story. "And that was how it happened," Asterion said, ending his story.

Thus Dunyazad ended her 3rd story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Dunyazad told:

## 2: Dunyazad's Story About Dunyazad

There was once a vast and perilous maze that had never known the light of the sun. Dunyazad was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Dunyazad entered a rococo colonnade, within which was found a monolith. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Dunyazad walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a high tablinum, containing a cartouche with a mirror inside. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

"Well," she said, "It is as confusing as this maze."

Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a Baroque portico, containing a fire in a low basin. Dunyazad muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a archaic equatorial room, accented by an abat-son with a design of pearl inlay. Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Dunyazad entered a marble-floored almonry, accented by a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of complex interlacing. And that was where the encounter between the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu took place. Murasaki Shikibu offered advice to Dunyazad in the form of a story. So Murasaki Shikibu began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And she told the following story:

## 3: Murasaki Shikibu's Story About Shahryar

There was once a twisted garden that lived in eternal twilight. Shahryar didn't know why he happened to be there. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Shahryar entered a marble-floored tetrasoon, decorated with a moasic framed by a pattern of complex interlacing. Shahryar thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Shahryar entered a archaic triclinium, tastefully offset by a fire in a low basin framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Shahryar entered a Baroque terrace, within which was found a cartouche with a mirror inside. Shahryar muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Shahryar entered a marble tepidarium, containing a sipapu. Shahryar opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Shahryar entered a Baroque twilit solar, tastefully offset by a gargoyle which was lined with a repeated pattern of buta motifs. Shahryar chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Shahryar entered a primitive triclinium, tastefully offset by many solomonic columns which was lined with a repeated pattern of red gems. Shahryar felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Shahryar entered a archaic tetrasoon, tastefully offset by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of pearl inlay. Shahryar discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Shahryar entered a high fogou, containing a fallen column. Shahryar felt sure that this must be the way out. At the darkest hour Shahryar found the exit. 

---

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Murasaki Shikibu said, ending the story. 

Dunyazad decided to travel onwards. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a high portico, dominated by a fireplace with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Dunyazad discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else, humming a little to relieve the silence. 

Dunyazad entered a marble-floored library, decorated with a large fresco of a garden with two paths dividing which was lined with a repeated pattern of complex interlacing. Dunyazad felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Dunyazad entered a luxurious cryptoporticus, containing an alcove. Dunyazad wandered, lost in thought. 

Dunyazad entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

"Well," she said, "Maybe it's a clue to where the exit is. Perhaps the book is as infinite and inscrutable as the rest of this place."

Dunyazad opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, humming a little to relieve the silence. Almost unable to believe it, Dunyazad discovered the way out. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Dunyazad said, ending her story.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 4th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

## 1: Scheherazade's Story About Murasaki Shikibu

There was once an expansive zone just on the other side of the garden wall. Murasaki Shikibu didn't know why she happened to be there. Murasaki Shikibu muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a Churrigueresque fogou, containing a gargoyle. Murasaki Shikibu opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Murasaki Shikibu felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a high portico, decorated with a great many columns with a design of a dizzying spiral pattern. Murasaki Shikibu walked away from that place. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a archaic fogou, dominated by a monolith which was lined with a repeated pattern of pearl inlay. And that was where the encounter between a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu and a king of Persia named Shahryar took place. Shahryar offered advice to Murasaki Shikibu in the form of a story. So Shahryar began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." And Shahryar told a very exciting story. "So you see how that story was very like this place," Shahryar said, ending the story.

Murasaki Shikibu entered a archaic fogou, dominated by a monolith which was lined with a repeated pattern of pearl inlay. Murasaki Shikibu discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. Murasaki Shikibu muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a Churrigueresque peristyle, tastefully offset by divans lining the perimeter framed by a pattern of winding knots. Murasaki Shikibu opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a ominous antechamber, decorated with a wood-framed mirror with a design of wooden carvings. Murasaki Shikibu chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Murasaki Shikibu entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Murasaki Shikibu felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors.

There was once a cybertextual data structure that had never known the light of the sun. Alice was almost certain about why she happened to be there. Alice wandered, lost in thought, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Alice entered a marble-floored darbazi, accented by a great many columns with a design of complex interlacing. Alice thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Alice entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, within which was found a pair of komaninu. Alice muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Alice entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Alice opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Alice entered a archaic still room, accented by a curved staircase framed by a pattern of pearl inlay. Alice chose an exit at random and walked that way.

Alice entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Alice walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Alice entered a neoclassic almonry, accented by a quatrefoil carved into the wall with a design of guilloché. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

"Well," she said, "It is as confusing as this maze."

Alice felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. Almost unable to believe it, Alice found the exit. 

---

Thus Scheherazade ended her 6th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

## 1: Scheherazade's Story About Kublai Khan

There was once a cybertextual data structure just on the other side of the garden wall. Kublai Khan must have spoken the unutterable word, because he had arrived in that place. Kublai Khan muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened. 

Kublai Khan entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Kublai Khan thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Kublai Khan entered a wide and low liwan, dominated by a standing stone inlayed with gold and framed by a pattern of egg-and-dart. Kublai Khan felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Kublai Khan entered a rococo hall of doors, that had a moasic. Kublai Khan walked away from that place. 

Kublai Khan entered a Churrigueresque cryptoporticus, watched over by xoanon. Kublai Khan felt sure that this must be the way out, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Kublai Khan entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Kublai Khan opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead, passing a reflection in a mirror. 

Kublai Khan entered a brick-walled atelier, containing a curved staircase. Kublai Khan chose an exit at random and walked that way, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. Which was where Kublai Khan found the exit.

Thus Scheherazade ended her 7th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

## 1: Scheherazade's Story About Dunyazad

There was once a vast and perilous maze that had never known the light of the sun. Dunyazad was lost, like so many before and after, and she had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Dunyazad chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Dunyazad entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a luxurious spicery, watched over by a fallen column. Dunyazad walked away from that place, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. 

Dunyazad entered a marble darbazi, within which was found a fireplace. There was a book here, and she opened it and read the following page:

"Well," she said, "It is as confusing as this maze."

Dunyazad felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors. 

Dunyazad entered a cramped and narrow fogou, watched over by a monolith. Dunyazad muttered, "North, this way is probably north!" as the door opened, not knowing that it was indeed the wrong way. At the darkest hour Dunyazad found the exit. 

---

Thus Scheherazade ended her 8th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So she began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Scheherazade told:

This is the story that Kublai Khan told:

## 2: Kublai Khan's Story About Little Nemo

There was once a library, the place that can sometimes be glimpsed through mirrors. Little Nemo wasn't quite sure where this was, only that he had come to that place, as we all eventually must.

## 7: Geoffery Chaucer's intertwined story

Once upon a time, there was a member of royalty named Asterion, a blind poet named Homer and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu.

"And that was how it happened," Homer said, ending his story.

"Well," he said, "Perhaps it's a list of names? Or a crossword puzzle that was filled in wrong. Perhaps there's a code."

Little Nemo chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Little Nemo entered a primitive anatomical theatre, containing an alcove. Little Nemo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Little Nemo entered a luxurious tablinum, tastefully offset by a cartouche with a mirror inside framed by a pattern of arabseque. Little Nemo felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Little Nemo entered a cramped and narrow still room, tastefully offset by a parquet floor which was lined with a repeated pattern of three hares. And that was where the encounter between a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo and an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer took place. Geoffery Chaucer offered advice to Little Nemo in the form of a story. So Geoffery Chaucer began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

## 6: Geoffery Chaucer's intertwined story

Once upon a time, there was a member of royalty named Asterion, a blind poet named Homer and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu. Homer suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Homer told a very contemplative story. "And that was how it happened," Homer said, ending his story. 

---

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Geoffery Chaucer said, ending the story. 

Little Nemo decided to travel onwards. Little Nemo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Little Nemo entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Little Nemo walked away from that place. 

Little Nemo entered a high fogou, containing a fallen column. Little Nemo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Little Nemo entered a primitive peristyle, decorated with a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of red gems. Little Nemo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. Quite unexpectedly Little Nemo discovered the way out. 

---

Thus Dante Alighieri ended his 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Dante Alighieri told:


## 5: Dante Alighieri's moving story

Once upon a time, there was a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri, the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a member of royalty named Asterion. Asterion suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Asterion told a very contemplative story. "And that was how it happened," Asterion said, ending his story. 

---

Thus Dante Alighieri ended his 2nd story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Dante Alighieri told:

## 5: Dante Alighieri's Story About Virgil

There was once a twisted garden, which is the world. Virgil was lost, like so many before and after, and he had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Virgil walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Virgil entered a high picture gallery, watched over by a glass-framed mirror. Virgil chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Virgil entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Virgil thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Virgil entered a ominous 사랑방, dominated by a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor with a design of wooden carvings. Virgil walked away from that place. 

Virgil entered a rococo triclinium, within which was found a pair of komaninu. Virgil discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Virgil entered a archaic equatorial room, accented by an abat-son with a design of pearl inlay. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Virgil entered a cramped and narrow fogou, watched over by a monolith. Virgil chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Virgil entered a Baroque cyzicene hall, within which was found a labyrinth pattern inscribed on the floor. Virgil thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. And there Virgil discovered the way out. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Dante Alighieri said, ending his story. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Murasaki Shikibu said, ending her story. 

---

Thus Asterion ended his 4th story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Asterion told:


## 3: Asterion's contemplative story

Once upon a time, there was a queen of Persia named Scheherazade, a blind poet named Homer and a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri. Dante Alighieri suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..."

## 4: Dante Alighieri's Story About Little Nemo

There was once a library that had never known the light of the sun. Little Nemo was almost certain about why he happened to be there. Little Nemo felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Little Nemo entered a luxurious cryptoporticus, containing an alcove. Little Nemo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Little Nemo entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Little Nemo chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Little Nemo entered a rococo hall of doors, that had a fireplace. Little Nemo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way.

There was once a cybertextual data structure that was a map of itself. Murasaki Shikibu wasn't quite sure where this was, only that she had come to that place, as we all eventually must.

"Well," he said, "Perhaps it's a list of names? Or a crossword puzzle that was filled in wrong. Perhaps there's a code."

Little Nemo chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Little Nemo entered a neoclassic terrace, watched over by a wood-framed mirror. Little Nemo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Little Nemo entered a marble atrium, accented by a koi pond which was lined with a repeated pattern of palmettes. Little Nemo felt sure that this must be the way out. 

Little Nemo entered a wide and low atelier, accented by a glass chandelier which was lined with a repeated pattern of egg-and-dart. And that was where the encounter between a child trying to go to Slumberland named Little Nemo and an English poet named Geoffery Chaucer took place. Geoffery Chaucer offered advice to Little Nemo in the form of a story. So Geoffery Chaucer began, "It seems to me that this place we find ourselves reminds me of when..." 

And he told the following story:

## 7: Geoffery Chaucer's intertwined story

Once upon a time, there was a member of royalty named Asterion, a blind poet named Homer and a lady of the Imperial Court named Murasaki Shikibu. Homer suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Homer told a very contemplative story. "And that was how it happened," Homer said, ending his story. 

---

"So you see how that story was very like this place," Geoffery Chaucer said, ending the story. 

Little Nemo decided to travel onwards. Little Nemo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Little Nemo entered a looming library, that had many solomonic columns. Little Nemo walked away from that place. 

Little Nemo entered a archaic hedge maze, that had a fallen column. Little Nemo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Little Nemo entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Little Nemo opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. 

Little Nemo entered a Churrigueresque almonry, watched over by a glass-framed mirror. Little Nemo chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Little Nemo entered a looming picture gallery, that had a fire in a low basin. Little Nemo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Little Nemo entered a Churrigueresque tablinum, tastefully offset by a great many columns with a design of winding knots. Little Nemo walked away from that place. Quite unexpectedly Little Nemo reached the end of the labyrinth. 

---

Thus Dante Alighieri ended his 1st story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Dante Alighieri told:


## 6: Dante Alighieri's moving story

Once upon a time, there was a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri, the sister of Scheherazade named Dunyazad and a member of royalty named Asterion. Asterion suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." And Asterion told a very contemplative story. "And that was how it happened," Asterion said, ending his story. 

---

Thus Dante Alighieri ended his 2nd story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Dante Alighieri told:

## 6: Dante Alighieri's Story About Virgil

There was once a twisted garden, which is the world. Virgil was lost, like so many before and after, and he had come to that place, as we all eventually must. Virgil walked away from that place, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Virgil entered a art deco atelier, containing a gilt-framed mirror. Virgil chose an exit at random and walked that way. 

Virgil entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Virgil thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Virgil entered a shadowy liwan, tastefully offset by a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of carved runes. Virgil walked away from that place. 

Virgil entered a art deco cryptoporticus, tastefully offset by a trompe-l'oeil fresco with a design of blue stones. Virgil discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Virgil entered a ominous lumber room, decorated with an obelisk with a design of wooden carvings. Virgil opened a door, not feeling quite sure where it lead. Quite unexpectedly Virgil discovered the way out. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Dante Alighieri said, ending his story. 

---

"And that was how it happened," Murasaki Shikibu said, ending her story.

Thus Geoffery Chaucer ended his 2nd story, saying, "But there is another tale which is more marvelous still."

So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Geoffery Chaucer told:


## 4: Geoffery Chaucer's contemplative story

Once upon a time, there was a queen of Persia named Scheherazade, a blind poet named Homer and a poet exiled from Florence named Dante Alighieri. Dante Alighieri suggested that he should tell a story, because it was Alex's birthday. So he began, "It is related, O august king, that..." 

This is the story that Dante Alighieri told:

## 5: Dante Alighieri's Story About Little Nemo

There was once a library that had never known the light of the sun. Little Nemo was almost certain about why he happened to be there. Little Nemo felt a bit dizzy at the confusion of doors, sparing a passing glance at a mirror. 

Little Nemo entered a looming atelier, accented by a pair of komaninu with a design of scratched markings. Little Nemo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Little Nemo entered a ominous tetrasoon, decorated with a quatrefoil inscribed in the ground framed by a pattern of wooden carvings. Little Nemo chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Little Nemo entered a ominous atrium, tastefully offset by an abat-son with a design of wooden carvings. Little Nemo thought that this direction looked promising, and went that way. 

Little Nemo entered a marble-floored spicery, accented by an empty cartouche which was lined with a repeated pattern of complex interlacing. There was a book here, and he opened it and read the following page:

"Well," he said, "Perhaps it's a list of names? Or a crossword puzzle that was filled in wrong. Perhaps there's a code."

Little Nemo chose an exit at random and walked that way, listening to the echo of footsteps. 

Little Nemo entered a primitive anatomical theatre, containing an alcove. Little Nemo discovered that one of the doors lead somewhere else. 

Little Nemo entered a shadowy almonry, that had a crumbling mound of earth. Little Nemo felt sure that this must be the way out.
