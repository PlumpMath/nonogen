NoNoGen: A novel generator that takes a (hopefully) novel approach.

## NaNoGenMo 2014

National Novel Generation Month Project 2014

[NaNoGenMo 2014] (https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014): It started as a joke on twitter by Darius Kazemi and grew into an entire month of people creating novel-writing generators. This one is mine.
